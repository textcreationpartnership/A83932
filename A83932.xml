            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <p>THe Lord Treasurer Reported, that he and the rest of the Lords Committees have been twice at <hi>Newgate</hi> to Examin the Prisoners, and gave the the House an account thereof, the Examinations were read as followeth.</p>
               <p>According to your Lordships Directions, we went yesterday in the Evening to Examin some of the Prisoners that are in <hi>Newgate</hi> for High Treason, in plotting and contriving the Death of His Majesty. Namely <hi>Thomas Jeninson, Edward Petre</hi> and <hi>William Ireland,</hi> who were one after another brought before us. And they do all obstinately deny their knowledg of any such Plot or Design, and would not make the least Confession of any thing Relating to it. Although according to the Authority we had, we promised not only a Pardon, but likewise a Reward to him that sh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>uld Confess in Truth.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Edward Petre</hi> was before us, we shewed him the Letter Directed to <hi>William Timstall,</hi> warning him to be at the Congregation in <hi>London</hi> the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> last, which he owned to be his hand writing, but as to the Design of the said meeting, he denies that he knows of any other then that of Choosing an Officer to send abroad.</p>
               <p>To <hi>William Ireland</hi> likewise we shewed some Letters and Papers (found among those that were seized) which he owns to be his hand, but denies that which was sent to <hi>Winsor</hi> to Mr. <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ennyfield,</hi> which he said was forged.</p>
               <pb n="16" facs="tcp:133176:10"/>
               <p> When we had done with these three Prisoners, we sent for Mr. <hi>Edward Coleman,</hi> who being brought before us; We put him in mind that when the day before, when he was charged by us for forged pretended letters in the Name of His Royal Highness, he then told us that if any such Letters were that they were not forged, we therefore now shewed him a draught of a <hi>Letter</hi> to be sent to Father <hi>Oliva,</hi> which he owned to be his hand and saith that it was from her Royal Highness the Dutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ess, and that he prepared it by her Order.</p>
               <p>We then shewed him a Letter drawn as from His Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness to father <hi>Le-Chese;</hi> which he likewise owned to be his hand, and that he shewed it to His Royall Highness. But that His Royal Highness rejected it, and he confest he had no Order from His Royal Highness to prepare it, but that he did it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his own head.</p>
               <p>Being asked whether he delivered a Letter to His Royal Highness from father <hi>Ferrier,</hi> he said Sir. <hi>William Trock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morton</hi> brought it, and he said he is sure he delivered one Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from <hi>Ferrier</hi> to His Royal Highness, and saith His Royal Highness was acquainted with his Correspondence with <hi>Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rier</hi> and S. <hi>Germain,</hi> not perhaps with every letter but in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral.</p>
               <p>He denied that ever he had any Correspondence with father <hi>Le-Chese,</hi> but by St. <hi>Germain,</hi> but he was convinced to the contrary when a Letter from <hi>Le Chese</hi> to him was produced, acknowledging the receipt of his long letter of the <hi>29th</hi> of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> 1674.</p>
               <p>Being asked of his going over to <hi>Brussels,</hi> he confest he was sent thither by His Royal Highness upon father <hi>Patricks</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over from the <hi>Inter-Nuntio</hi> there with an imperfect story, and that from that time the Correspondence was carried on all along, he said the L. <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Warder</hi> knew of his going, and that His Royal Highness was acquainted with the summ and substance of the Correspondence with the <hi>Inter-Nuntio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this we likewise offered him (as we were directed) that he should be pardoned and rewarded if he would disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it, by making a Franck Confession of what he knew. And to induce him to it, we told him that without any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Confession there was enough in his Papers for the Law to take away his life, but we could not make him own the knowledg of any thing further, but that he had been Guilty of a great many follies.</p>
               <p>Whereupon it was asked him what made him desire to speak with His Majesty and His Royal Highness, when we sent for him the day before. To which he answered, that it was to
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:133176:10"/> know how he should Govern himself, as to naming the Duke.</p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> being likewise asked on <hi>Sunday,</hi> why he had taken such liberty of speaking of the Kings Ministers, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching some of them with breach of faith, and promises with his Royal Highness in Order to any of those ends which he expected should be promised by them, and whether he knew or had heard of any such thing concerning them or any of them, whom he had mentioned in his said Letters, he answe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red he had not, but had been foolish in that as well as in other things in delivering his own Opinion, and that he had no other ground for it.</p>
               <p>We further observe to your Lordships, that neither <hi>William Ireland,</hi> nor <hi>Thomas Jennison</hi> (who were examined yesterday) nor <hi>Smith,</hi> whom we examined last <hi>Sunday,</hi> will own any knowledg of the Congregation of the <hi>24th.</hi> of <hi>April</hi> last, only <hi>Edward Petre,</hi> upon whom the knowledg of it was proved by his own letter to <hi>William Tunstal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After Debate this Question was proposed.</p>
               <p>Whether these Papers should be Communicated to the House of Commons presently at a Conference in Order to the joint advice of both Houses.</p>
               <p>Then this previous question was put, whether this questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on shall be put, it was Resolved in the Negative.</p>
               <p>These Lords following desired leave to enter their Dissents if the question was carried in the Negative, and accordingly entred their Dissent.</p>

               <p>THe Lord Bishop of <hi>Rochester</hi> Reported from the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee appointed to inquire into the Horrid Design a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst His Majesty, that their Lordships are unsatisfied with the delivery of some papers to Mr. <hi>Colcman,</hi> by one Captain <hi>Berkeley</hi> which were not read at Councel, who was examined at the Committee and now attends at the Door.</p>
               <p>His Lordship Reported farther, that the Lord <hi>Annesley</hi> Eldest Son to the E. of <hi>Anglesey</hi> Lord Privy Seal informed the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, that <hi>Titus Oats</hi> told him he could say something to the House towards the Clearing of His Royal Highness the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> from the Aspertions which were cast on him, and that <hi>Titus Oats</hi> is attending in the Lord Chancellors Room.</p>
               <p>Upon which Captain <hi>Berkley</hi> being called in, gave an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to the House, that he delivered those papers to the Duke of <hi>Monmouth,</hi> and receiving them again from the Duke of
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:133176:11"/>
                  <hi>Monmouth,</hi> did give them to Mr. <hi>Coleman,</hi> pleading his igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the way he ought to have proceeded in, for which he is very sorry. Upon which (the House satisfied that the Duke of <hi>Monmouth</hi> did give the said papers to His Majesty, who perused them and returned them to the Duke of <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,)</hi> the Lord Chancellor by Command of the House, gave him publick Reprehension for his indiscretion, and so he withdrew.</p>
               <p>Then <hi>Titus Oats</hi> being called in, was sworne at the Bar, and required to answer to what he is now called in for concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning his discourse with the Lord <hi>Annesley</hi> last Night about the Duke of <hi>York,</hi> he spake to this effect. That he was informed that Mr. <hi>Coleman</hi> had highly Impeached the Duke of <hi>York</hi> by letters; to which he said he thought the Duke was wholy innocent, for these Reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because they have a Counterfeit Seal of his and her Royal Highness, and that he was sent into <hi>Spain</hi> with Creden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials under that Seal, being asked where that Seal is, he said it is in the Custody of <hi>Richard Strange</hi> the late Provincial of the Jesuites, that the party who signed his Credentials writt <hi>James,</hi> but he was not then so well acquainted with the Jesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites as to know who it was.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Because in <hi>February</hi> or <hi>March</hi> last, a proposal was made by the Fathers at <hi>Gant,</hi> that they wondred the Duke was not acquainted with it, to which, Answer was made because his love was great to the King his Brother, that he would not be true to them though he was a very good <hi>Catholick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Because there was a Letter writt to <hi>Blundel</hi> saying, they longed to see the Duke trappanned into the business.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Because there were a parcel of Letters at <hi>Windsor</hi> to be delivered to His Royal Highness, that he might burn them, thereby to draw the Duke into the Plot. This he said he was not certain of, but <hi>Meredith Loyd</hi> said they brought them to the Duke for that purpose, and he would bring him hither to Attest it.</p>
               <p n="5">5. He said [being askt] that he carried no Letters into <hi>Spain</hi> signed <hi>James</hi> by the Duke, but the Credentials he had to <hi>Spain</hi> with him were signed and sealed in his presence by the Jesuites, <hi>James,</hi> and the Counterfeit Seal, so that he was received like a kind of Ambassador. both as from the Duke and the Society.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Because they have made Officers of State and War without the Dukes Privity.</p>
               <p>Then he was commanded to withdraw.</p>
               <p>Upon consideration of what <hi>Titus Oats</hi> had said, he was
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:133176:12"/> called in again and told by the Lord Chancellor, that the House hath directed he shall be heard again, to morrow a Nine of the Clock.

               <p>Ordered by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Assembled, that <hi>Nathaniel Thompson</hi> who is now in the Custody of <hi>William Sorocoal,</hi> for Printing Popish Books, for <hi>James Thompson</hi> shall stand Committed to the Prison of the <hi>Gate house</hi> at <hi>Westminster</hi> during the pleasure of this House, and this shall be a sufficient Warrant on that behalf.</p>

<pb n="39" facs="tcp:133176:21"/> the Examination, which was taken of him by Sir <hi>Thomas Stringer</hi> to be upon Oath, and that the Paper which they shewed him (which was put into their hands from Sir <hi>Thomas Stringer)</hi> was a copy of his said Examination, but he denyes that he was Examined by the Lord Chief Justice, or that he ever received any Letter or Commission whatsoever from Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> or that he knows any thing of any Plot against His Majesties Service or against the Government.</p>
               <p>Sir <hi>William Goring</hi> was before them next, who likewise denyed any kind of knowledg of those things which he was accused of, or that he knew any such Man as Mr. <hi>Oates.</hi>

               <p>Being askt, his Lordship further declared he never saw Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> in his life, and that he never was at Mr. <hi>Langhorns</hi> Chamber but once, and never saw him but that time, and that he never did any business for him, and that he was so far from having any acquaintance with Mr. <hi>Langhorns</hi> Sons, that he did not know Mr. <hi>Langhorn</hi> was Marryed until he lately askt the question.

               <p>The Lords caused him after he had distinctly read every sheet to set his hand to every sheet, and the Lords are of Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that he hath been very careful and exact in his Testimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, in not accusing any one further then he had perfect memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of, and of what he knows of his knowledge or from the mouthes of others.</p>
               <p>The Lords have many other Examinations concerning the Death of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> not yet perfected, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they think fit yet to keep them private, when perfected will make Report of them to your Lordships.</p>

               </p>
               <p>Afterwards he desired him this Deponent to walk into the midst of the Court, where he the said <hi>Le Phaire</hi> might say something to this Deponent, and no Body over hear it, and there he told this Deponent that the Person who he was to Kill was Killed, and that his Body then lay in <hi>Sommerset-house,</hi> and that he did believe that the excuse which this Deponent had made him before for not coming to the Murthering of him was real, and that he knew his fidelity was such, that he should have half the Reward, if he would help to carry the Body to a place where they had chose to lay him.</p>
               <p>This Deponent asked to know first, who were to be the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons that were to go with him, <hi>Le Phaire</hi> told him they were himself, Mr. <hi>Walsh</hi> the Lord <hi>Bellasis</hi> Gentleman, Mr. <hi>Atkins (Pepis</hi> Clerk) and one that he hath often seen in the Queens Chappel, and did believe to be one that belonged to the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. <hi>Then</hi> Le Phaire <hi>brought this Deponent by the Hand in the dark through the Entry into that Room which he shewed the Duke of</hi> Monmouth, <hi>and knocked softiy with his Finger at the Door, and when it was opened</hi> Le Phaire <hi>led this Deponent into it which was dark,</hi> Le Phaire <hi>then pulled a dark Lanthorn from under his Coat</hi>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:133176:27"/>
                  <hi>and shewed a small light in the Rome, where this Deponent saw the Persons before named, of whom this Deponent knew</hi> Le Phaire, <hi>Mr.</hi> Walsh <hi>and the other Person he saw often in the Chappel, and the other two owned themselves the one to be the Lord</hi> Bellasis <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and the other to be Mr.</hi> Atkins <hi>(Pepis Clerk).</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this Deponent saith, that they did agree to carry the Body in a Chair to the corner of <hi>Clarendon</hi> house, and there to put him in a Coach to carry him to the place where he was found, having concluded this they agreed to carry him off at Eleven of the Clock the same night, then some of them turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about they throwed off a Cloak that lay upon him, and shewed this Deponent the Body. This Deponent asked them who it was, they told him it was an old man that belonged to a Person of Quality, who had taken some Examinations tend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Discovery of their design, this Deponent asked them further, why it was not more proper to Kill the Person of Quality himself, they answered no, for this man had the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations in his own Custody, and that their design of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting him thither, was to get him to send for them by fair means or fowl, and then they did not question but the next Examination would be so contrary to that, it would appear upon their Tryals two several Stories, and when they should be brought to Tryal upon the latter Examination, they would produce the former to contradict it, that it might seem partiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the World, upon which reasons the Deponent seemed satisfied, and asked them where they Killed him, they told him at <hi>Sommerset house.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then this Deponent begged their pardon for half an hour and he would wait on them again, but this Deponent went a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way and came no more, but the next day about Eleven of the Clock this Deponent met <hi>Le Phaire</hi> by accident, crossing <hi>Lin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>colns-Inn Fields,</hi> and then they went together unto the <hi>Gray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hound</hi> Tavern in <hi>Fleet-street,</hi> Le Phaire <hi>(putting his Cane up to his Nose) said he had something to say to him,</hi> Le Phaire <hi>there charged this Deponent for not coming the last Night according to his promise, this Deponent told him he was unwilling to come be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he knew the Person.</hi> Le Phaire <hi>asked him then who it was, this Deponent told him it was Justice</hi> Godfrey, Le Phaire <hi>then acknowledged it was so, and he was willing to dispense with this Deponents not coming, if he would assure him of his Fidelity.</hi>

               <p>This Deponent then asked <hi>Le Phaire</hi> how they got him thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and where they found him, <hi>Le Phaire</hi> told him that him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, <hi>Walsh</hi> and the Lord <hi>Bellasis</hi> Gentleman met him by the <hi>Kings head Inn</hi> in the <hi>Strand,</hi> crossing the street about Five of the Clock, and told him that if he would please to go with

Then they asked him to send for those Examinations he had taken about those that were committed, he answered they were not in his power for he had sent them to <hi>Whitehall,</hi> upon that and his refusing to answer other questions they seized him and stifled him with a pillow, and so they thought he had been dead but coming into the Room sometime after they found him strugling, and then they strangled him with a long Cravat, (which Cravat the Deponent saw the <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day</hi> at Night about his neck) then this Deponent asked <hi>Le Phaire</hi> why they carryed him into the Fields, and what they designed by it, he answered that they had made a Wound in his Body and laid his Sword by him that it should seem he had Killed himself, and that they did not question that the discovery o<gap reason="illegible: right margin cropped or obscured" resp="#keyers" extent="1+ letters">

                  <hi>A Message was brought from the House of Commons by Mr. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary</hi> Coventry <hi>and others, that the Commons in Parliament Assembled, reflecting on the imminent dangers wherein the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is involved, by the restless conspiracies of Popish Recusants against His Majesties Person, and the Religion and Government establisht do find themselves necessitated, to remind your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships for a speedy proceeding on the Bill before you entituled, an Act for the more effectual preserving the Kings Person and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by disabling Papists from sitting in either House of Parliament, without which they think themselves unable to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare any effectual remedies to prevent the Evils that hang over us.</hi>

As to the Address of a Reward to such Person or Persons as shall discover what is become of Mr. <hi>Powel,</hi> who hath been sometime missing, and of whom there are strong presumptions that he is murthered, His Majesty looks on this as imperfect, supposing the Reward is not intended to be given to such as shall discover where he is if Living, and having withdrawn himself upon his own occasions, but if he be murthered or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:133176:38"/> by any Persons that are guilty of the Horrid Design a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst His Majesties Person or Government.</p>

               <p>The Lord <hi>Carington</hi> being in his place, acquainted the House that he was informed his name was spoke of in the House of Commons, as if he had been guilty of the horrid design against His Majesty, which he abhors, and that His Lordship hears there is a Warrant out against him from the Lord Chief Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice of <hi>England,</hi> his Lordship pleaded his innocence and sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted himself to their Lordships pleasure.</p>
               <p>Hereupon the House sent to the Lord Chief Justice to come, that they may receive an account from him of the business, who being come did let the House know that being sent for Yesterday by the House of Commons, he took the Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>William Bedloe</hi> upon Oath in the Speakers Chamber, who (among other Persons) accused the Lord <hi>Carington</hi> to be with several other considerable Persons, in a confederacy for raising money and men to carry on the design against the Kings Person and Governmenr.

               <p>After consideration had hereof, the ensuing question being put, whether that the Lord <hi>Carington</hi> should be Committed to the custody of the Black Rod, upon the Information given by the Lord Chief Justice, it was resolved in the Affirmative.</p>

                  <hi>Upon Information received this day from the Lord Chief Justice of</hi> England, <hi>concerning the Lord</hi> Carington <hi>a Member of this House, It is resolved by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament Assembled, that the said Lord</hi> Carington <hi>shall stand Committed to the Gentleman Usher of the Black Rod attending this House, there to remain in safe custody till further Order, and this shall be a sufficient Warrant on that behalf.</hi>

               <p>This Day <hi>Charles Price,</hi> who was one of those Persons sent for to be taken into custody by the Serjeant at Arms, about the late horrid design was brought to the Bar, and being asked whether he knew Mr. <hi>Spalding</hi> the under Governor of <hi>Chepstow</hi> Castle, he said he did, then he was told, that he was charged with confederacy to deliver up <hi>Chepstow</hi> Castle to the Earl of <hi>Powis,</hi> which he denyed, was Ordered to withdraw, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the House made this Order.</p>
               <p>Whereas <hi>Charles Price,</hi> who was to be taken into custody by the Serjeant at Armes attending this House, hath this day appeared at the Bar denying what is charged on him, It is Ordered, by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Assembled, that the said <hi>Charles Price</hi> shall stand com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the Prison of the Kings Bench, there to remain in safe custody till further Order, and that the Serjeant at Arms attending this House, or his Deputies take care to convey him to the said Prison, and this shall be a sufficient Warrant on that behalf.</p>
               <p>The Lord Chancellor told the Lord <hi>Carington</hi> what the House had resolved concerning him, and upon what grounds, and asked him whether he had any thing further to say at this time, and his Lordship said not, only submitted himself to their Lordships pleasure.</p>
               <p>Then the House was adjourned into a Committee, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed in the further consideration of the Bill, for the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual preserving the Person of His Majesty, the House was resumed, and the Earl of <hi>Bridgewater</hi> Reported, that the House have spent some time in consideration of the said Bill,

               <p>The Lord Treasurer Reported, that the Lords with White Staves have presented to His Majesty the second Address for a General Pardon, and considerable Reward to be given to such Person or Persons as shall discover what is become of Mr. <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el,</hi> who hath been sometime missing, and of whom there are strong presumptions that he is murthered. His Majesty observes this Address to be imperfect in the same manner as the first Address was, but His Majesty understanding what your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships mean by it, if it be left to him, will do thereon what shall be fitting, which the House agreed to.</p>
               <p>The Lord Treasurer acquainted the House, that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> had sent to him for Two Hundred Pound, whereas he hath had paid him already One Hundred and Twenty Pound, to supply his necessities.</p>

               <p>The Question being put whether this Bill shall pass, it was Resolved in the Affirmative.</p>

               <p>The House was adjourned during pleasure and the Lords went to the conference, which being ended the House was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumed, then the Lord Chancellor Reported the effect of the conference, which was, that the House of Commons agrees to the proviso added by their Lordships to the Bill, for the more effectual preserving of His Majesties Person and Government, but as to the Amendments concerning the Servants of Her
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:133176:46"/> Majesty and the Dutchess, they do not agree for these Reasons following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That both Houses having declared by their Vote, that the Kings Person is at this time in danger from Popish Conspiracies, it would not only be most dangerous to His Majesties Person, but incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent with such a Declaration to admit any Popish Recusant to have Residance in his Pallaces and such familiar access into His Majesties presence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That all Popish Recusants being by His Majesties Proclamation issued at the desire of both Houses, required to depart Ten Miles from the Cities of</hi> London <hi>and</hi> Westminster, <hi>we cannot think it advisable to admit them now to continue in His Majesties Houses, where they may be of greater danger than in any other place.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That the design of this Act being for a further security a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst all Popish Recusants, the Commons cannot think it reasonable to allow any of them priviledge contrary to the Law already in being.</p>
               <p>Your Lordships amendments, excepting by general words such a number of Servants of the Queen and Her Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, it will follow that if any Peers of this Kingdom or Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the House of Commons be nominated by them, they will thereby be still capable of sitting and voting in the House of Peers or House of Commons, without taking the Oathes or Test.</p>
               <p>As to the Amendment of the word <hi>(Administrator)</hi> being miswritten, the Commons do agree.</p>
               <p>Upon consideration of the abovesaid Reasons, the Lords agreed to have a conference with the House of Commons, and propose unto them in the Sixth <hi>sk</hi> ten <hi>l,</hi> to leave out the words (or Queen.)</p>
               <p>In the 7 <hi>sk</hi> 1 <hi>l,</hi> to leave out the proviso concerning the Queens Servants.</p>

               <p>The Lord <hi>Mainard</hi> Reported, that the Lords with the white Staves presented to His Majesty two Addresses from this House.</p>

               <p>His Majesty sayes he will give Order for it accordingly.</p>

               <p>The answer returned was, that the Lords will give a Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as is desired, and appoint the same to be presently in the painted Chamber.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Hodie prima vice licita est Billa</hi> an Act for preserving the Peace of the Kingdom, by raising the <hi>Militia</hi> and continuing them in Duty for 42 Dayes</p>
               <p>The same Lords as mannaged the last Conference are to be Reporters of this.</p>
               <p>The House was adjourned during pleasure, and the Lords went to the Conference, which being ended the House was resumed.</p>
               <pb n="96" facs="tcp:133176:50"/>
               <p> The Lord Chancellor Reported the Effect of the Confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence as followeth.</p>
               <p>That the House of Commons do not agree with their Lordships in that matter, nor form as was delivered at the last Conference and that for these reasons,</p>
               <p>That it is contrary to the constant method and proceedings in Parliament, to strike out any thing in a Bill, which hath been fully agreed and passed by both Houses, and it would make the work endless, and might also be of dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, if that method should be deserted and changed.</p>
               <p>In the amendments proposed to the Bill by your Lordships, to which the Commons have disagreed the Number of the Queens Servants to be Excepted out of the act was limited, but by leaving the Queens name out of the Bill, She may have them without number, so that what is now Offered is worse than what the Commons have already disagreed to, &amp; consequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly hath not the nature of an expedient.</p>
               <p>That by experience it is found, that the act intituled an act for preventing Dangers, which may happen from <hi>Popish</hi> Recusants proved ineffectual to remove Papists from Court, by reason there was no express mention'd of the Queens Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants.</p>
               <p>The Scope of the Bill relateth not onely to remove Papists out of both Houses of Parliament, but also from the Court, as appeareth both by the preamble and body of the Bill, and the Danger of His Majesty may reasonably be supposed to be chiefly in his Court and the safety of his person, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons think ought more to be considered, then any respects to any person whatsoever.</p>
               <p>Therefore the Commons say they cannot agree with your Lordships, neither in the expedient nor amendments.</p>
               <p>The Lords taking the matter of the aforesaid Conference into consideration; and well weighing what great concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment this Bill was of, came to these Resolutions following.</p>
               <p>It is agreed to insist on that amendment (or hereafter shall be)</p>
               <p>The question being put whether any number of men Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that are the Kings Subjects and <hi>Roman Catholicks</hi> shall be insisted upon to be the Queens Servants, and be part of the Bill, it was Resolved in the Negative.</p>
               <p>Agreed to insist that the Queen shall have Nine women Servants <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Agreed to insist that the Dutchess of <hi>York</hi> shall have Five women Servants <hi>Roman Catholicks.</hi>

                  <hi>Titus Oates</hi> being called in at the Bar, desired he might be heard a few words before he was sworn to speak to the main business, which being granted to him, he complained of the restraint he is under, and being debarred of the liberty of his friends coming to him, and of conversing with any body in private, and that no English man ought to be restrained, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less accused by one or more witnesses, and prayed that the restraint might be taken off, that he might be enabled to give his evidence more chearfully, and that the House would be pleased to Address to the King for that purpose, and that his pardon may be renewed, because he is under misprision of Treason: To which the Lord Chancellour told him that the House would take his condition into consideration, and then being sworn, he was told by the Lord Chancellour, that the Lords have received an Address from the House of Commons in part upon evidence by him given there, and that the House expects he should give an account what that is, which hath begot such an astonishment in the House of Commons, as is expressed in the Address. Upon which, <hi>Titus Oates</hi> said, <hi>That in</hi> July <hi>last, he saw a Letter from Sir</hi> George Wakeman <hi>to</hi> Richard Ashby <hi>alias</hi> Thimbleby; <hi>in this Letter he gave him an account of the proposals made for destroying the King, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared his liking thereof, provided his Reward might be answer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and told him the Queen consort did approve of them, which were to poyson the King; and being asked whether he knew Sir</hi> George Wakemans <hi>hand writing, he said, no, but</hi> Thimbleby <hi>told him it was Sir</hi> George Wakemans <hi>Letter.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That in the same <hi>July,</hi> a Messenger came with a Letter to <hi>William Hartcourt</hi> for him, and <hi>John Keynes, Basil Langworth</hi> and <hi>John Fenwick</hi> to attend the Queen at <hi>Sommerset-house,</hi> which they accordingly did, taking him with them, <hi>Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>court</hi> telling him he must go, when they were there, having passed by the presence, he was left in an Anti-chamber, and they went into another Room, but the door not being quite shut, he heard a Woman say, <hi>That she would no longer indure these affronts, but would revenge the Violation of her Bed, and assist in propagating the Catholick Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He saith he heard the words spoken, and when the Fathers came out, he being desirous to see the Queen, was introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by <hi>Langworth</hi> or <hi>Fenwick,</hi> and saw no woman there but the Queen with these Fathers.</p>
               <p>He said further, That the Queen had given several sums of money to <hi>Corker</hi> a Benedictine under the notion of charity,
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:133176:55"/> which he believes was only to pervert the Kings Subjects in their Religion, and that if <hi>Irelands</hi> papers be again searched, it will be found that several of them have had monney upon that account, and some so small shares as two or three shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, and that he himself had had several sums. <hi>That as a circumstance to induce a belief that the Queen was ingaged in this business, he saith be saw</hi> Micho's <hi>Letter to the General of the Iesuites, wherein was mentioned of Four thousand at one time, and One thousand at another time given by the Queen, which he cannot say upon his Oath, but believes was given upon this account.</hi> Upon which a Complement was sent to the Queen, Duke and Dutchess of Five hundred Masses, Six hundred and odd pair of Beads, and One thousand one hundred and fifty Acts of mortification as a return for former favours; <hi>Whitebread</hi> being then Provincial, he refers himself to the Letter which may be found amongst <hi>Micho's</hi> or <hi>Whitebreads</hi> Papers.</p>
               <p>Then being asked whether this is all he had to say in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the Queen, he said this is all as to matter of Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, saving only that he added, <hi>that the Queen holds corre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spondency with the Bishop of</hi> Rome, <hi>and the General of the Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of Iesuits.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then being asked whether Mrs. <hi>Elliot</hi> came first to him from the King, or he did send her first to the King about his speaking with the King; he said she came first to him, and told him the King would speak with him, but whether she came from the King he knows not, but saith he never desired her to speak with the King</p>
               <p>He saith further, that when he went to the King on the 13. instant, the King was dis-satisfied with what he said, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause there was one present, whom he believed to be an Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to the King and Kingdom, he did not speak so freely as otherwise he should have done.</p>
               <p>Then being asked why he said (the last time he was here) that he had no other person to accuse being then required to name them (if any such were) of what quality soever, he said that he had no more to name, meaning of this House be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore whom he then was, and that he then desired that he might not be further pressed to say any more in prejudice of the evidence he was to give.</p>
               <p>Then being ask<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d why he concealed this matter so long, he said, <hi>It was because the Queen was the Wife of the Kings bosom, &amp; he had not then acquainted the King with it, and therefore thought not fit to mention it before a publick Councel, and if therein he erred in his judgment, it was not his intention so to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="107" facs="tcp:133176:55"/>
               <p> Then he said this Plot was designed in 1670. he believes it was so in 1666. Further he could swear that their own Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords say it was designed upon the Kings coming in, in 1660. And being asked why he knowing this matter of the Queens being in it in <hi>July</hi> and <hi>August</hi> last, did not acquaint the King with it till <hi>November;</hi> he said, that the Queen was not to act till all other practises failed, and that then she was to have further notice. And being asked how he knew that the Queen had not notice in all this time, he said it was to be done when the King should take Physick, which was not done because of his going to <hi>New market,</hi> and being told that if he had mentioned this matter of Sir <hi>George Wakemans Letter</hi> so fully at the Councel as he hath done now, Sir <hi>George</hi> had then been taken in custody. To this he said, that he had been up all the <hi>Saturday</hi> and <hi>Sunday</hi> at night, and had atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded the Councel so long, that he was ready to faint, and that the weakness of his body so confounded his memory, that he forgot to mention that Letter.</p>
               <p>Then being commanded to withdraw, Mrs. <hi>Elliot</hi> was sent for.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then</hi> William Bedloe <hi>being called in, and Sworn, is told of the occasion of his coming hither upon the Address now brought up from the House of Commons, and that his whole knowledg con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this matter is expected from him, upon which he said that about the end of</hi> April <hi>or beginning of</hi> May 1677. <hi>There was a Consult held in the Chappel Gallery at</hi> Sommerset-house▪ <hi>where were present the Lord</hi> Bellasis, <hi>Mr.</hi> Coleman, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> Lathan, <hi>and two</hi> French Abbots <hi>and the Queen, (and he thinks the Lord</hi> Powis) <hi>that he was below in the Chappel with</hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> Walsh <hi>and others at the same time, and when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult was over,</hi> Coleman <hi>came down and told</hi> Walsh <hi>and him that the Queen wept much before they could bring Her to it, but the</hi> French Abbots <hi>by their Arguments had prevailed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then he said that he was afterwards dispatched by <hi>Cole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> with <hi>Letters</hi> for <hi>France,</hi> and that he overtook <hi>Stapleton</hi> at <hi>Cambray,</hi> for whom he had <hi>Letters,</hi> which <hi>Letters Stapleton</hi> read by a Key or Cypher which he had in his hand, that <hi>Staple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton</hi> (after he had read them) said I am glad they have brought Her to it, our party growes Stronger and Stronger, and <hi>Bedloe</hi> asking who was meant by Her, <hi>Stapleton</hi> said the Queen, and that he received this <hi>Letter</hi> from <hi>Coleman</hi> in his own house.</p>
               <p>Then being asked whether he knew the Lord <hi>Bellasis,</hi> he said he did, and had seen him at his house in St. <hi>Albones Square</hi>
                  <pb n="108" facs="tcp:133176:56"/> about three years since, and said he had no more to say of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Person either in or out of this house then he had already charged.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Then being asked where he stood in the Chappel, when the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sult was above, he said he came in from the water Side through the Room, where the Priests put on their Vestments, and standing below, he saw the Queen look over the Railes of the Gallery.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Then being asked whether he knew Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> he said he remembred he had seen the man at <hi>Vallidolid</hi> about a Month before <hi>Micbaelmas</hi> last was Twelvemoneth, but knew not that he was concerned in this Business, and that he went there by the name of <hi>Ambrose,</hi> and that when he was formerly asked here if he knew him, he denied it, because he knew him not by that name of <hi>Oates,</hi> and had not then seen him here.</p>
               <p>Then Mrs. <hi>Elliot</hi> being come is called in, and sworn, and is asked whether Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> sent her first to the King or the King sent her first to Mr. <hi>Oates,</hi> she said the Lady <hi>Gerara</hi> of <hi>Bromley</hi> told her Dr. <hi>Tong</hi> would speak with her, who told her coming to him that Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> must needs speak with the King privately, and being asked whether Dr. <hi>Tong</hi> told her what it was about, she said that by the words he spoak, she guessed the Queen was concerned, but she did not here him say why or wherein, and that she went to the King before she spake with Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> at Dr. <hi>Tongs</hi> desire.</p>
               <p>After this the <hi>Papers</hi> that were brought in from the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel were read as followeth.</p>

                           <p>That in the Moneth of <hi>July</hi> last he saw a <hi>Letter</hi> written from Sir <hi>Georg Wakeman</hi> to <hi>Richard Ashby, alias Thimbleby</hi> advising him for his health, being troubled with the <hi>Gout,</hi> to take a pinte of milk in the morning and a pinte at night, and also 100 stroakes of the Pump every day while he continued at the Bath.</p>
                           <p>That in the same <hi>Letter</hi> Sir <hi>George Wakeman</hi> did declare his good liklng of the proposals about poysoning the King provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded good termes might be had, and added that the Queen would give her assistance in that work.</p>
                           <p>That in the same Moneth of <hi>July</hi> there came a messenger to have some of the fathers to attend at <hi>Sommerset-house,</hi> who were <hi>John Keines, William Hartcourt, John Fenwick,</hi> and <hi>Bazil Langworth,</hi> the messenger was one Sir <hi>Richard</hi> or <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert</hi> he knowes not whether, being a man of middle Stature, and about Forty four or Forty five years of Age and a Nimble man.</p>
                           <p>That being at <hi>Sommerset-house</hi> they went all into an Anti-Chamber that he himself and some others (whom he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers not) were in the Room without, but that he being curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to here what passed within, and the Door not being quite close, listned and did here a womans voice, (though he saw not who it was) <hi>to say that she would no longer endure those affronts but would revenge the violation of Her Bed, and would assist in taking away the Kings Life, and propagating</hi> Catholick <hi>Religion.</hi>

                           <p>That upon opening of the Door he desired one of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he might see the Queen, and being admitted he doth on his Salvation declare, that he saw no body but the Queen and the said Fathers.</p>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> being afterwards asked if the Queen saw him when he was presented, he said She did and took as much no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him as one of her ranck usually doth of such as he was, being then in another habit then at present, but he thought She gave him a gratious smile.</p>
                           <pb n="110" facs="tcp:133176:57"/>
                           <p> That the Queen under the notion of Charity hath given to Mr. <hi>Corker</hi> several sums of money in order to pervert His Majesties Subjects in their Religion, and that if Mr. <hi>Irelands</hi> Papers be again examined it will appear that there was made distributions of this Charity, and some so small as two or three Shillings, whereof he himself has had some share.</p>
                           <p>That as a Cicumstance to induce a belief that the Queen was ingaged in this matter, he saies he saw a <hi>Letter</hi> which <hi>Micho</hi> had prepared to the General of the Jesuites wherein was mentioned of Five thousand pound given by Her Majesty, Four thousand pound at one time, and One thousand pound at another, which he cannot swear was for this end but verily believes it was, and being asked how he came to see that <hi>Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> he saies <hi>Micho</hi> the Secretary of the order consulted with him about a <hi>Latine</hi> Phraise, and he advised him to put a word into the Dative case as being better <hi>Latine.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>That as to the question why he concealed this important matter so long, he answered that he had much distrust with himself in his judgment about the discovering it, and that once he intended to disclose it upon Sir <hi>George Wakemans</hi> busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness at this Board, but was willing His Majesty should know it first in private.</p>
                           <p>And further upon this account and the objection that <hi>Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering</hi> was imployed to have killed the King with a Pistol and Silver Bullets, and that he had been disciplined with twenty Stroakes for having failed (which was before the Consult in <hi>April</hi> last as near as he remembers) it appeared the business was committed to others hands to be executed, he answered hereunto that the matter had been designed in the year 1670. and that he knew Her Majesty (let her vertues be what they will) held correspondence with the Bishop of <hi>Rome</hi> and the General of the Jesuites by hands of the Jesuites here, but that She was not to Act until they judged things to be ripe, and he further said that endevours were used that the Queen should not be engaged in this business till all other meanes failed.</p>
                           <p>
                              <hi>He further added as to the said question of his being so long silent in a matter of that dangerous consequence, that he was unwilling to communicate any thing of the Queen to any publike Court, but only to the King himself in private, to prevent the danger She be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the wife of his Bosom.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>He saies he cannot remember the precise day when these words were spoken, but that it was on a week day not on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           <p>And as to the place where he heard the same, he saies he

                           <p>Being put in mind that he had declared at the Bar of the House of Peers, that he had no more to say against any Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of Quality, he answered his meaning was that he had no more against any of that House before whom he then was, and prayed their Lordships to remember that he then desired he might not be further pressed to say any more to the end his E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence might not be superceded.</p>
                           <p>And being further questioned how it came about that he could not give an account of the precise day when those words were spoken, having in other things referred himself to his Papers, he declared that he had not committed this thing to Writing, not daring to trust more with it then his own Soul, yet he hopes he may recollect something as to the very time and would Examine his Papers, but that they are in the custo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Mr. <hi>Thomas Howard.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>Being asked whether he knew <hi>Bedloe</hi> before, he said 'tis like he had seen him but not by that name, but that if he had seen him 'twas in <hi>Spain,</hi> and as going by the name of <hi>Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams,</hi> but that he never knew him as concerned in this busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness.</p>
                           <p>Mr. <hi>Oates</hi> being asked how many several hands he could write, did answer, that he never had been taught any but had learnt of himself, and did write differently according as his Pen was, and that when he saw a hand that pleased him he endeavored to imitate the same.</p>
                           <p>Being further demanded, why he had omitted so material a thing against Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> as the dangerous <hi>Letter</hi> written by him to <hi>Thimbleby</hi> aforementioned, for nothing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears of it in the first minutes taken at the Councel board a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Sir <hi>George Wakeman,</hi> he answered that he was at that time faint and week, and had been up two Nights together, nor could he then have said that he saw Sir <hi>George</hi> write such a <hi>Letter,</hi> but that he saw a <hi>Letter</hi> signed <hi>George Wakeman</hi> in <hi>Thimbleby</hi>'s Chamber.</p>

                           <p>Touching which it was told him, that he had indeed made mention of such an Entry Book at the Bar of the House of Commons, but no mention of it at this board, to which he

               <p>The Commons being come with their Speaker, the Clerk of the Crown read the Titles of these two Bills, and the Clerk of the Parliaments pronounced His Majesties pleasure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them.</p>

               <p>After this His Majesty made a short Speech to this effect.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>He told the Lords and Commons that he did not refuse to pass this Act for the dislike of the matter, but the manner, because it puts out of his power the</hi> Militia <hi>for so many days, if it bad been but for half an hour, he would not have consented to it, because of the ill consequences it may have hereafter, the</hi> Militia <hi>being wholly in the Crown, and so far as he is enabled by Law to raise the</hi> Militia, <hi>if they will enable him with money to pay them, he shall imploy such of them as he thinks fit, and are necessary for the safety of himself and the Kingdom.</hi>

                  <hi>His Majesty said he had passed the other Bill, which is of very great importance, of which there may be ill consequences hereafter, but he was willing to oblige them, who have thought it fitting at this time, and hopes that they will be careful to give him all due satisfaction for the future.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This day the Lord Chancellour by Intimation from the Duke of <hi>Norfolk,</hi> acquainted the House with a doubt that was concerned in Law, that if there was not an immediate proceeding to take the Oaths, and Declaration prescribed in the Act Entituled for the more effectual preserving the Kings Person and Government, by disabling Papists from sitting in either House of Parliament; It would be questionable whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther there could be a House of Peers on <hi>Munday</hi> to supply that defect, and though the Lords were of opinion that it was not of absolute necessity so to do, and that there would be no danger of Dissolving the House by omitting it. Yet never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theless for avoiding of all Scruples and Objections that might otherwise be made: some of their Lordships did immediately take the said Oaths, and make and subscribe the Declaration with resolution to repeat the same on <hi>Munday,</hi> which being done, the House was moved to take notice of the good ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the Duke of <hi>Norfolk</hi> herein before his withdrawing, which their Lordships took very well from him, and Ordered that a Memorial thereof be entred in the Journal of this House for the honor of his Grace.</p>
               <p>Then these Lords following did take the Oaths, and make and subscribe the Declaration in the pursuance of the Act, for the more effectual preserving the Kings Person and Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by disabling Papists from sitting in either House of Parliament.</p>

                           <p>In Obedience to Your Majesties Order Signified to us this Morning in Councel, we have been at <hi>Sommerset-house</hi> and there taken the Examination of <hi>Miles Prance</hi> a Siver-smith, touching the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmond-Bury Godfrey</hi> upon the place where the same was committed, &amp; by vertue of the Oath taken before Your Majesty, he Declared as followeth.</p>
                           <p>That, it was either of the latter End or the Beginning of the week▪ that Sir <hi>Edmond Godfrey</hi> did about Nine of the Clock at Night pass from towards St. <hi>Clements</hi> as far as the great Water-Gate at <hi>Sommerset-house</hi> being watched and followed by <hi>Lawrence Hill,</hi> one <hi>Green</hi> and one <hi>Gerald,</hi> that <hi>Hill</hi> making
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:133176:86"/> some hast before stept within the wicket, which was open and turning soon again called to Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> as he was passing, and said, that there were two Men quarrelling within, who might soon be quieted if once they saw him, whereupon he entred through the Wicket, and after him <hi>Green</hi> and <hi>Gerald,</hi> and down all went till they came to a Bench rhat is at the Bottom of the steep Descent, and joyning to a Rail next, to the upper end of the Stables on the Right hand, that upon the said Bench there were sitting and attending their coming, the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant <hi>Miles Prance,</hi> one <hi>Berry</hi> the Porter of the other Gate together with an <hi>Irish</hi> Man that lodged at <hi>Greens</hi> house, whose Name he knowes not, and by that time they were come half way down, he the said <hi>Prance</hi> went up to the Wicket, there to attend and give notice if any came, and at the said time the said <hi>Berry</hi> went strait on from the Bench towards the Stone staires, which lead to the upper Court, that when Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond Godfrey</hi> came down to the Bench, <hi>Green</hi> who followed him put about his Neck a large twisted Hand-kerchief, and thereupon all the rest assisted and dragged him into a Corner which is behind the said Bench and the said Rail, and <hi>Green</hi> who informed him in the manner hereof, and with whom he had before seen the said large twisted Hand-kerchief, added that he had thumped him on the Breast and twisted his Neck until he broak it.</p>
                           <p>And the Examinant saith, that he did in about a quarter of an Hour after he had been standing at the Wicket come down to see what was done, and found that they had throtled him, but his Body remained warm and seemed hardly dead, but he together with the said <hi>Hill, Green, Gerald</hi> and <hi>Berry,</hi> and the <hi>Irish</hi> Man took him up and conveyed him through a Door, which is on the left hand coming downe at the Corner of the Coach house, which leads up several Staires into a long dark passage or gallery opening at last into the upper Court, in which passage there is a Door on the left hand, which being opened leads up with Eight staires into another house adjoyning, but immediatly on the Right hand being got up there is a little Closet or Square Room, into which they conveyed the Body, and there set the Body bending with the Back against a Bed, which the Examinant having now seen again thinks to be the same Bed that was there at the said time, he further said, that <hi>Hill</hi> lived at this house, and that the Body was for two days left there in his care, but then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affraid of Discovery, <hi>Hill▪ Gerald, Green, Berry</hi> and the <hi>Irish</hi> Man as they told him, did take and convey the Body from thence about Nine or Ten of the Clock at Night, and carried
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:133176:87"/> it into the house, and into some Room towards the Garden, and that while that the Body lay there, he was by <hi>Hill</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducted to see it and saw the Body as it lay bended, and <hi>Green</hi> and <hi>Gerald</hi> were present.</p>
                           <p>That from thence upon a <hi>Tuesday</hi> Night the Body was brought back near to the place, where first it lay into a Room in the said Gallery over against the first Door somewhat higher up towards the Court, the Chamber belonging unto some of the servants of Sir <hi>John Arundel,</hi> where it remained until Nine or Ten of the Ciock on <hi>Wednesday</hi> Night, and then thinking fit to remove it to the little Room where first it lay, the Ez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminant happened to come as they werere lifting it up the said Eight steps, whereupon <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Berry</hi> fled as supposing him to be some Stranger, but <hi>Gerald, Green</hi> and the <hi>Irish</hi> Man stood still. And so he helped them, to lift up the Body into the former Closet, and there it continued till after Twelve a Clock the same <hi>Wednesday</hi> Night, <hi>Hill</hi> and <hi>Berry</hi> came to them when their Fright was over, and <hi>Hill</hi> having got a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dan and placing it in the long dark Entry at the Foot of the said Eight staires, they put the Body thereinto, the Examinant <hi>Prance</hi> and <hi>Gerald</hi> first took up the Chair and conveyed it through the upper Court, <hi>Berry</hi> the Porter opened half the Gate and let them out, and they Rested not till they came to <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> where <hi>Green</hi> and another <hi>Irish</hi> Man took their Turns, and so carried the Sedan and Body in it as far as the New <hi>Grecian</hi> Church in the <hi>So Ho,</hi> and there <hi>Hill</hi> met them with a Horse, whereupon they took out the Body, and forcing open the Legs they set it upon the Horse, <hi>Hill</hi> riding behind to keep the Body up, while <hi>Green, Gerald</hi> and the <hi>Irish</hi> Man went on to accompany him, <hi>Berry</hi> the Porter did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from the the Gate, and the Examinant <hi>Prance</hi> fearing to be missed returned home when the Body was set on Horse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, and the Sedan which was left in one of the New unfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished houses, they took up and brought it home as they came back.</p>
                           <p>He further saith, that the Body lay in <hi>Sommerset house</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout six or seven Days before it was carried out, but he is not certain in the Number of the days.</p>
                           <p>He was very positive as to the place, where the Murther was committed and the manner of it, as also for the Room where the Body was first laid, but being desired to conduct us to the Room he spoak of near the Garden, he led us to the Corner of the <hi>Piazza</hi> on the Left hand, and so down a pair of Staires and so far seemed to be assured that he had been led, and did think that he had passed through the great Court be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low,
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:133176:87"/> but when from thence we went up and down into seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Rooms, he seemed very doubtful and could not ascertain the place, saying that he had never been there but that once when <hi>Hill</hi> conveyed him thither with a Dark Lanthorn, but that it was some Chamber towards the Garden.</p>
                           <p>In the House where the Body was first laid we found a Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whose deposition we have taken, she was House-keeper to Dr. <hi>Godden,</hi> and the said <hi>Hill</hi> had been a Servant to the said Doctor in this House for above Seven Years, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to live there since the Doctors departure until <hi>Michael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas</hi> last, but that he hath been there several times since, and she also knew the Examinant and called him by his name.</p>
                           <p>All which is humbly submitted to your Majesty.</p>

               <p>Upon reading of which report, it appeared that the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars were very consonant to what he had spoke at the Board in the Morning before his going, at which time being also fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther asked, why he gave so different a Relation to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Lords from what he now so freely confessed, he made answer that he was in much confusion before the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee being not sure of his Pardon, but now being sure of it, and also upon his Oath he did speak the whole truth according to his knowledg, and being further asked why he came not in upon the Proclamation and the Rewards thereof, he said he was afraid to trust thereunto, and being further asked what reward he had received from those that imployed him, he said he had yet received no reward nor had he sought for any, but only the promise of <hi>Gerald</hi> that there should be a reward by the L. <hi>Bellasis,</hi> he said that he wrought in the way of his Trade to the Queens Chappel and was a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> but that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Eight weeks ago he had taken the Oathes, being asked whether there were no Guards at the usual places at the time of carrying on this work, he says he did not take notice of any, and being asked whether he saw <hi>Bedloe,</hi> when he was carryed to see the Body when it lay in the back Chambers near the Garden, he answered he could not tell whether <hi>Bedloe</hi> was there or no, but does well remember that <hi>Gerald</hi> and <hi>Green</hi> were then present, he adds that <hi>Hill, Green</hi> and <hi>Gerald</hi> told him, that they had at <hi>Prim-Rose-Hill</hi> thrust Sir <hi>Edmonds</hi> Sword through his Body till it came an inch out at his Back, and that he strugled very much at the time they strangled him,
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:133176:88"/> but that <hi>Green</hi> punched him with his Knees upon his Body to hasten his death.</p>
               <p>The Councel sat again in the Afternoon.</p>
               <p>His Majesty having been informed that the said <hi>Lawrence Hill, Henry Berry,</hi> and <hi>Robert Green</hi> had been taken, the two former secured in <hi>Newgate,</hi> and the latter in the <hi>Gate-house,</hi> and having commanded them to be brought in the Afternoon, <hi>Robert Green</hi> was called in, and being Examined did say that he had lived for above ten years at <hi>Sommerset-house,</hi> his business being to lay Cushions in the Chappel, that he knew <hi>Hill</hi> Dr. <hi>Goddens</hi> Man, also <hi>Gerald</hi> that was of the <hi>Venetian</hi> Ambassa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dors meaning of the Resident, whom he supposes to be a Priest, that he knows <hi>Prance</hi> the Gold-smith to the House, but for Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> he never saw him dead or alive, that he never carryed a Sedan or any dead Body to his knowledg and so utterly denyed every thing relating to the Murther.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prance</hi> being called in and confronted urged the matter un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, how he the said <hi>Green</hi> had been at Sir <hi>Edmonds-house,</hi> followed him from place to place, shewed him the twisted Handkerchief before he did the work, and many other parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars mentioned in the report, and how could he deny them. <hi>Green</hi> denyed every particular, and said all was false, <hi>Prance</hi> asked if he knew him, <hi>Green</hi> replyed yes very well, and had drunk with him, but he knew not Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> or had ever seen him, yes said <hi>Prance</hi> we have often drunk toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the <hi>Plow,</hi> and there I shewed you Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> as he pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed by, telling you, that he was the Man that would not allow the Queens Servants any priviledg, <hi>Prance</hi> further askt him what was the <hi>Irish</hi> Mans name (a short well set Man) that lay at such a time in his House, he answered his name was <hi>Kelley</hi> an <hi>Irish</hi> Priest who went away a Fortnight before the Proclamation, and that he belongs as he does think to a <hi>Welsh</hi> Gentlewoman that is a <hi>Roman Catholick,</hi> and being further asked how he came to be found out of his House, he saith that at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> for about Four Nights he was put out of his Lodging by some People of Sir <hi>John Arundels</hi> for their conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niency, he further saith he never had any quarrel with Mr. <hi>Prance</hi> or any thing to say against him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Lawrence Hill</hi> being called in, says that he had been long a Servant at <hi>Sommerset house,</hi> that he knew <hi>Green, Gerald,</hi> and <hi>Prance,</hi> but not <hi>Kelley,</hi> that he never had any quarrel with <hi>Prance,</hi> and for ought he knew he might be an honest man, that he had not long since been drinking at his House in <hi>Stanhop-street,</hi>
                  <pb n="173" facs="tcp:133176:88"/> where he keeps a Victualling house, which he hired and where he has lived since a Fortnight after <hi>Michaelmas</hi> last, that he never saw Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> but once at <hi>Som<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merset-house,</hi> which was upon occasion of a Pick Pocket that was there taken, that he was about the middle of <hi>October</hi> bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sie about settling himself in the House he now is ln, that the day Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> was Killed he was agreeing with his Landlord for the said House, but had not setled the agreement till the <hi>Wednesday</hi> after, that he never Rid with Sir <hi>Edmond</hi> upon a Horse, and knew very little of him, and denies vehemently all that is charged against him.</p>
               <p>It may here properly be remembred that <hi>Anne Broad-street</hi> formerly House-keeper to Dr. <hi>Godden</hi> did in her deposition affirm, that <hi>Lawrence Hill</hi> left that place at <hi>Michaelmas</hi> or thereabouts going then to a House of his own in <hi>Stanhop-street,</hi> but when <hi>Prance</hi> told her she was mistaken, and that he did not leave this Lodging there in <hi>Sommerset house</hi> until a Fortnight after <hi>Michaelmas,</hi> the seemed very warmly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict him, whereas <hi>Hill</hi> himself doth better agree with <hi>Prance</hi> concerning the time.</p>
               <p>Prance <hi>being called in, accuses</hi> Hill <hi>of all the particulars to his Face, which he denies again with imprecations, and when His Majesty asked</hi> Prance <hi>whether he would on his Salvation de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare all he said to be true, he made answer that it was as true as God is true, and that he did on his Salvation affirm it,</hi> Hill <hi>saith that</hi> Prance <hi>testifyeth all this to save himself, whereupon being askt the meaning of these words he said he spoke the discourse of his House when People were drinking, and did there report that</hi> Prance <hi>was pardoned, but he then little thought that he should come to be questioned on such an account, being further asked a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the said</hi> Kelly, <hi>be said there was such a man did frequent the</hi> Queens Chappel, <hi>and</hi> Prance <hi>being asked the color of the Horse which</hi> Hill <hi>brought for the Body, he said, that though the Night was dark yet he could discern the Horse to be a brown Horse.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Henry Berry</hi> being called in, says that he knows <hi>Green</hi> the Cushion keeper, that he knows not <hi>Kelley</hi> nor <hi>Gerald,</hi> that he knows <hi>Hill</hi> since he first came to <hi>Sommerset-house</hi> as a Servant to Dr. <hi>Godden,</hi> that he knows <hi>Prance</hi> and has seen him at Chappel and never heard ill of him, but denies that he ever acted any thing with him concerning Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> or ever sat with him upon that Bench, that he has seen Sir <hi>Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond,</hi> and particularly as he past by about a year ago, but that he knew him not, or ever saw him dead, or knew that he ever went out in a <hi>Sedan,</hi> or that ever he saw <hi>Prance, Green</hi> of <hi>Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rald</hi> carry a <hi>Sedan.</hi>

               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:133176:89"/>
               <p> Prance <hi>being called in urges home upon</hi> Berry <hi>all the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars afore mentioned, and the share he had therein. As to the sitting upon the Bench,</hi> Berry <hi>doth acknowledge that he hath often sat there, and sometimes with one</hi> Bourk <hi>that lay at</hi> Greens <hi>house but never with him, be disownes all the accusation but saies if he had done such a thing he would not deny it,</hi> Prance <hi>is as positive and constant in all things on the other side, saying there was a time that he also denied things as stifly as they.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prisoners were all returned to the places from whence they came.</p>

                              <hi>Staff.</hi> The information of <hi>Stephen Dugdale</hi> Gentleman late Servant to the Lord <hi>Aston</hi> of <hi>Tixhall,</hi> concerning the Plot against Our Sovereign Lord the King as follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
                           <p n="1">1. This Informant saith, that presently after one <hi>Howard Almoner</hi> to the Queen went beyond the Seas, he was told by <hi>George Hopson</hi> (Servant to the said Lord <hi>Aston)</hi> that there was a Design then intended for the Reformation of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, to the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion.</p>
                           <p n="2">2. He informeth that in the beginning of <hi>September</hi> 1678. he met in <hi>Tixhall</hi> Hall nigh the Lords Gates the Lord <hi>Stafford,</hi> who said to this informant, it was sad for that they were trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled for that they could not say their Prayers but in a hid manner, but suddenly there would be a Reformation to the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion, and if there was but a good success they should enjoy their Religion, and upon the <hi>20th.</hi> Day of <hi>Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember</hi> last, the said Lord <hi>Stafford</hi> told this Informant that there was a Design in hand, and if this Informant would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the Design, he should have a good Reward and make himself Famous.</p>
                           <p n="3">3.

                        <p>I meet you here with the most earnest desire that Man can have, to unite the minds of all my Subjects, both to me and to one another. And I resolve it shall be your faults, if the success be not suitable to my desires, I have done ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny great things already in order to that end, as the Exclusion of the Popish Lords from their Seats in Parliament, the Execution of several men both upon the score of the Plot, and of the Murther of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> and it is apparent that I have not been idle in Prose<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting the Discovery of both as much further, as hath been possible in so short a time.</p>
                        <p>I have disbanded as much of the Army as I could get money to do, and I am ready to Disband the rest so soon as you shall Reem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bur'st what they have cost me, and will enable me to pay off the Remainder, and above all, I have commanded my Brother to absent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:133176:93"/> from me, because I would not leave the most malicious men room to say I had not remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all causes, which could be pretended to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence me toward Popish Councels.</p>
                        <p>Besides that end of Union which I aim at (and which I wish could be extended to Protestants abroad as well as at home) I propose by this last great step I have made to discern, whether Protestant Religion and the Peace of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom be as truly aimed at by others as they are really intended by me, for if they be, you will <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">

I hope there will be none such amongst you, because there can be no man that must not see how fatal differences amongst our selves are like to be at this time, both at home and abroad.</p>
                        <p>I shall not cease my endeavors dayly to find out what more I can, both of the Plot and Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey,</hi> and shall desire the Assistance of both my Houses in that work.</p>
                        <p>I have not been wanting to give orders for putting all the present Laws in Execution a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Papists, and I am ready to joyn in the making such further Laws as may be necessary for securing of the Kingdom against Popery.</p>
                        <p>I must desire your Assistance also in supplyes, both for Disbanding the Army (as I have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready told you) and for paying that part of the <hi>Fleet</hi> which hath been provided for by Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:133176:93"/> but till the Fifth of <hi>June</hi> last, as also that debt for stores which was occasioned by the Poll-Bills falling short of the summ which that Act gave Credit for.</p>
                        <p>I must necessarily recommend to you likewise the discharging of those Anticipations, which are upon my Revenue, and which I have comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be laid before you, and I have just cause to desire such an increase of the Revenue it self, as might make it equal to my necessary expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, but by reason of those other supplyes which are absolutely necessary at this time, I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented to struggle with that difficulty a while longer, expecting for the present only to have the Additional Duties upon Customs and Excise to be prolonged to me, and that you will some way make up the loss I sustain by the prohibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>French</hi> Wines and Brandy, which turns on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to my prejudice, and to the great Advantage of the <hi>French.</hi>
                        </p>
                        <p>I must needs put you in mind how necessary it will be to have a good strength at Sea, this Summer, since our Neighbors are making Naval preparations. And notwithstanding the great Difficulties I labour under, I have taken such care as will prevent any Danger which can threaten us, if your parts be performed in time, and I do heartily recommend to you that such a constant Establishment might be made for the Navy, as might make this Kingdom not only safe but formidable, which can never be whilst there remains not enough besides to pay the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Charges of the Crown.</p>
                        <p>I will conclude as I begun with my earnest desires to have this an healing Parliament, and do give you this Assurance, that I will with my
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:133176:94"/> Life defend both the Protestant Religion and the Laws of this Kingdom, and I do expect from you to be Defended from the Calumny as well as danger of those worst of men, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to render me and my Government odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to my People.</p>

                           <salute>My Lords and you the Knights, Citizens and Burgesses of the House of Commons.</salute>
                        </opener>
                        <p>YOƲ are here Assembled by virtue of His Majesties most gracious writs of Summons to hold a Parliament, the Great, the Wise, and the Powerful Councel of this Kingdom. From the Wisdom of this Councel, the King is sure he shall receive the best Advice, from the Duty and Loyalty of this Assembly, He can never want a chearful Assistance; and the King resolves to meet you all with so much Grace and Goodness, that he hopes this Parliament shall end in no disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of any but our Enemies.</p>
                        <p>It may seem strange perhaps to some, that His Majesty who had so long and large an Experience of the Duty of the last Parliament, should now and in this present Conjuncture think fit to call a new one. But the King hath so equal a Confidence in the affections of all his good Subjects, that he intends to be acquainted with them all, and have many and
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:133176:94"/> frequent Consultations with them, and hopes by this means to attain first a true and right understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the desires of his People, and next to that to be rightly understood by them.</p>
                        <p>The Considerations which are now to be laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you are as urgent and as weighty as ever were yet offered to any Parliament, or indeed ever can be; so great and so surprizing have been our Dangers at home, so formidable are the appearances of Danger from abroad, that the most united Councels, the most sedate and the calmest temper, together with the most Dutiful and Zealous Affections that a Parliament can shew, are all become absolutely and indispensibly necessary for our Preservation.</p>
                        <p>At Home we had need look about us, for His Majesties Royal Person hath been in danger by a Conspiracy against his Sacred Life, malitiously con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived and industriously carryed on by those Semina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Priests and Jesuits, and their Adherents, who think themselves under some obligation of Conscience to effect it, and having vowed the Subversion of the true Religion amongst us, find no way so likely to compass it, as to wound us in the head, and to Kill the Defender of the Faith.</p>
                        <p>His Majesty wanted not sufficient Evidence of his Zeal for our Religion, without this Testimony from his Enemies, who were about to Sacrifice him for it, but it hath ever been the practice of those Votaries first to Murther the Fame of Princes, and then their Persons, first to slander them to their People as if they favored Papists, and then to assassinate them for being too Zealous Protestants, and this by all the ways and means which our Law calls Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son, and their Divinity calls Merit and Martyrdom. They are trying to set up the Dominion and the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>premacy of the Pope, as if the Dignity of his Triple
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:133176:95"/> Crown could never sufficiently be Advanced, unless these three Kingdoms were added unto them, and all brought back again under that Yoake which neither we nor our Fore-fathers were able to bear.</p>
                        <p>The enquiry into this Conspiracy hath been close<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pursued, and the Lords of the Councel have been careful to prosecute the Discovery ever since the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of the last Parliament, and the King doth now Recommend it to you to perfect, more Evidence hath been already found out, and more Malefactors discovered, some in hold, some fled, Justices of Peace have been quickened in the Execution of their Duty, the negligent have been Reproved and Punished, the diligent encouraged and assisted in doubtful cases by the opinions of the Judges, Active and Faithful Messengers have been sent into all the corners of the Kingdom where there was any hope of service to be done, the very Prisons have been searched to see if any had fled thither to hide themselves there, and under pretence of debt to escape the pursuit, and if any have desired leave to go beyond Sea, they have first given security not to go to <hi>Rome,</hi> nor send their Children to be bred in any Forraign Seminaries, and they have been obliged to give in a List of all their Menial Servants, and those Servants too have been Examined at the Ports, and make Oath they are the same Persons who were Examined above, so that all possible care hath been taken that no Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lefactors might escape us in Disguise.</p>
                        <p>And though the Priests themselves do not keep the Confessions of their Proselytes more secret, than these keep the Injunctions of their Priests, yet enough hath appeared to bring some Capital Offenders to publick Justice, and to convict them of the Crime; some of the Traytors have been Executed, several Priests have been Arrested and Imprisoned, all are hiding
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:133176:95"/> themselves and lurking in secret corners like the Sons of Darkness. The Murtherers of Sir <hi>Edmondbury Godfrey</hi> have been Condemned and suffered Death, some Papists have Banisht themselves out of the Kingdom, others are Imprisoned for not taking the Oathes, all are persecuted towards Conviction, and the very shame and reproach which attends such a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bominable practices hath covered so many Faces with new and strange Confusions, that it hath prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a powerful Argument for their Conversion, nor is it to be wondred at, that they could no longer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve all to be Gospel which their Priests taught them, when they saw the way and means of intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing it, was so far from being Angelical.</p>
                        <p>In a word, so universal is that despair to wbich the Papists are now reduced, that they have no other hopes left but this, that we may chance to over-do our own business, and by being too far transported with the fears of Popery, neglect the opportunities we now have, of making sober and lasting provisions against it.</p>
                        <p>And 'tis not to be doubted, but that it would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely gratifie the Papists in the revenge they wish for this Discovery, if they could see us distracted with Jealousies incurable, and distrusting the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to such a degree as should weaken all that Reverence by which it stands, for then the Plot would not be altogether without effect; but those whom they could not destroy by their Conspiracy, they should have the satisfaction to see ruining themselves after the Discovery, so that, though we had escap't that Desolation, which they intended to have brought upon us, nothing should save us from that Destruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion we should bring upon our selves.</p>
                        <p>But their Expectations of this are as vain as their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Designs wicked; For His Majesty hath already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:133176:96"/> to let them see with what severity he intends to proceed against them. He hath passed a Law to disable all the Nobility and Gentry of that faction ever to sit in Parliament, and not content with that, he did offer to the last Parliament, and does again renew the same offer to this Parliament, to pass a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny further Laws against Popery, which shall be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired, so as the same extend not to the Diminution of his own Prerogative, nor to alter the descent of the Crown, in the right Line, nor to defeat the Succession. He hath refused the Petition of the Lords, who during the Interval of Parliament defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to be brought to their Tryal, and after so long Imprisonment might reasonably enough expect it. But His Majesty thought it fitter to reserve them to a more publick and Conspicuous Tryal in Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for which cause their Tryal ought now to be hastened, for it is high time their should be some Period put to the Imprisonment of the Lords.</p>
                        <p>But that which the King hath been pleased to mention to you this Morning, surpasseth all the rest, and is sufficient of it self alone to discharge all those fears of Popish Influences, which many good men had too far entertained, for now you see His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty hath done that of his own accord, which would have been very difficult for you to ask, and hath deprived himself of the Conversation of his Royal and only Brother, by Commanding him to depart the Kingdom. To which Command his Royal High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness hath paid a most humble and a most intire Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission and Obedience, this Separation was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a more than Ordinary Sorrow on both sides, but he that for your sakes could part with such a Brother and such a Friend, you may be sure hath now no favorite but his People, since therefore, His Majesty hath shewn so much readiness to concur with
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:133176:96"/> and in a manner to prevent the desires of His Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, 'Tis a miserable Refuge our Enemies trust to, when they hope to see our Zeal out-run our dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion; and that we our selves should become the unhappy occasion of making our own Councels abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                        <p>Not only the care of the State, but the care we ought to have to the Church to, will preserve us from all Errors of this Kind, for as their neither is nor hath been these Fifteen Hundred Years a purer Church than ours, so it is for the sake of this pure Church alone, that the State hath been so much disturbed, it is her truth and peace, her decency and Order, which they Labor to undermine and pursue with so restless a Malice, and since they do so, it will be necessary for us to distinguish between Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish and other Recusants, between them that would destroy the whole Flock, and them that only wander from it, and amongst the many good Laws you shall think fit to provide, it may not be amiss to think of some better Remedy for regulating the Press, from whence there dayly steal forth Popish Catechismes, Psalters, and Books of Controversie, and it may be another good fruit of such a Law to hinder Schis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matical and Seditious Libels to, for certainly it were much better for us to make such Laws as will prevent Offences, rather than such as serve only to Punish Offenders.</p>
                        <p>From the Dangers which we know at home, and have already in a great measure overcome, be pleas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to carry your Considerations abroad, and weigh the dangers which may come from thence.</p>
                        <p>We all see and know the Posture of our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and that the general Peace of <hi>Europe</hi> being once made there must needs be great Fleets and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies unimployed and ready for an occasion, and 'tis
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:133176:97"/> as visible, that some of our Neighbors are so wasted by the War, that they are unable to give us any help if we should stand in need of it, and when we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider withal the afflicted Condition of the Protestants abroad, we may be sure that every calamity they suffer is in some measure a weaking of the Protestant Interest, and looks as if it were intended to make way for a general Extirpation.</p>
                        <p>These dangers would not be so considerable as they are, if the present wants of the Crown were not too well known. The King doth not intend to press you at this time with the full Consideration of them all, for as the King cannot hope in any one Session to do all that may be good for his People, so neither doth he expect from them all that may be necessary for himself; but hopes the good understanding between him and his People, shall be for ever maintained by a perpetual reciprocation of Grace and Favor on his part, and duty and affection on yours.</p>
                        <p>That which doth most press the King at present, is the want of that Treasure which he hath exhaust<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by going as far as he could in the Disbanding of his Army, which is very much but not fully done. The Charge of a great Fleet at Sea now ready to be paid off after a long service, and the necessity of setting out another this Summer. The Defects of the Poll-Bill which fell short of that Summ which was allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be borrowed upon it, and by that means hath deceived those who did furnish stores upon the Credit of that Act, unless you relieve them, together with the continuation of some Additional Duties of Custome and Excise; and it were much to be wished, that since the Revenue at the best was always short of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary Charge of the Government, a way may be found to take off those Debts and Anticipations, and to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:133176:97"/> that Diminution of the Customes, which makes it much narrower than it was.</p>

                        <p>There are so many things to do and so little time to do them in, that there ought not to be one Minute lost. The season of the year is not yet so far advanced as to make it too late to set out a Fleet this Summer, for most of the preparations are ready, if we go about it with that diligence which is requisite, and therefore it doth infinitely import us all to Husband time.</p>
                        <p>The best way of doing this will be to avoid all long and tedious Consultations, which sometimes do as much harm, as ill Resolutions, and above all to take heed of such questions and debates as tend to raise heat, or cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate any kind of Disturbance, nor does any thing in the World so much contribute to dispatch as a quiet and orderly proceeding, for they who are in hast and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to do all their business at once, most commonly hinder themselves from bringing any thing to perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction.</p>
                        <p>You have now an opportunity of doing great things for the King and Kingdom, and it deserves your ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most care to make a right use of it, for 'tis not in the Power of a Parliament to recover a lost opportunity, or to restore themselves again to the same circumstances or the same condition, which they had once a Power to have improved.</p>
                        <p>Would you secure Religion at home and strengthen it from abroad by uniting the interests of all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testants in <hi>Europe?</hi> this is the time.</p>
                        <p>Would you let the Christian World see the King in a Condition able to protect those who shall adhere to him or depend upon him? This is the time.</p>
                        <p>Would you extinguish all our fears and Jealousies? Would you lay aside all private Animosities, and give
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:133176:98"/> them up to the quiet and repose of the publick? This is the time.</p>
                        <p>Would you lay the Foundations of a lasting peace, and secure the Church and state against all the future Machinations of our Enemies? This is the time.</p>

                        <p>The present face of things and the State wherein we now are, is so well known and understood abroad, that the whole World is in great expectation of those Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which shall be taken here; the results of this Councel seem to be derisive of the Fate of these King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms for many Ages, and are like to determine us ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to happiness or misery of a very long Duration.</p>
                        <p>We use to say and say truly, that the King when Seated in Parliament is then in the fullness of His Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty and Power, and Shines forth with the brightest Lustre, let no Exhalations from beneath darken or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure it.</p>
                        <p>Forraign Nations say and say truly, that a King of <hi>England</hi> in Conjunction with his Parliament, is as great and dreadful a Prince as any in <hi>Europe,</hi> shew them the sight they are afraid of, and since they have laid it down for a Maxime in their Politiques; that <hi>England</hi> can never be destroyed but by it self, and that 'tis in vain to make any Attempt upon this Nation, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they be in some great danger and confusion among themselves, make the Ambitious despair betimes and establish so perfect an Intelligence between all the parts of this great body, that there may be but one heart and one Soul among us.</p>
                        <p>And let us all pray, that he who hath once more miraculously delivered the King, the Church and the State, would be pleased still to continue his Divine Protection, and give us thankful and obedient Hearts, and when we have offered up those hearts to God, let us
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:133176:98"/> in the next place offer them again to the King, and lay them down at the Foot-stool of his Throne, that so the King may see himself safe in your Councels, rich in your affections, victorious by your Arms, and rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to such a heigth by your Loyalty and Courage, that you may have the Honor of making him the greatest King, and he the Glory of making you the happiest People.</p>
                        <p>I have but one thing more in Command, and that is to the Gentlemen of the House of Commons, that they proceed immediatly to the Choice of a Speaker, whom His Majesty will expect to be presented to him here, at three of the Clock to Morrow in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon.</p>

                  <hi>Ordered,</hi> that this Bill is committed to the Committee of the whole House, and to be taken into consideration on <hi>Friday</hi> Morning next.</p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury</hi> Reported, that the Committee ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed yesterday to consider in what State the Impeachments in the last Parliament now stand, have perused the Journal of this House, and find that the 5. Day of <hi>December</hi> 1678. the Impeachments against the Five Lords, now Prisoners in the <hi>Tower</hi> were brought from the House of Commons, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted of a general Charge of Treason, and other high Crimes; the House of Commons declaring they would in convenient time Exhibit the Articles of their charge against them.</p>
               <p>The next day, this House appointed to go upon the conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of these Impeachments, and all the Judges were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to be then present, but nothing was done thereon.</p>

               <p>That the Lord Treasurer desired Copies of all the Papers and proceedings concerning this Business.</p>
               <p>And it was then resolved upon the question, that the Lord Treasurer should not withdraw.</p>
               <p>It further appears, that on the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>December</hi> 1678 the Lord Treasurer moved the House for a Copy of his Charge, and that he might not lie long under it; whereupon it was mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

                           </p>
                           <p>This Examinant saith, that he and Mr. <hi>Maddison</hi> a Barber in <hi>Holborne,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Staley,</hi> were drinking at the Cross-keys <hi>Tavern</hi> over against <hi>Staleys</hi> house, about a Fortnight before the said <hi>Staley</hi> was taken, where complaining of the great persecutions that the <hi>Papists</hi> lay under, and that if they did not take some speedy Course to destroy their Enemies, they should be Ruined. The said <hi>Staley</hi> and <hi>Maddison</hi> resolved to Kill the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> as the Ringleader of the Mischief, that they feared would fall them, <hi>Maddison</hi> saying, that he would engage three <hi>viz. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damson</hi> a Watchmaker, <hi>Prosser</hi> a Silver▪smith; and <hi>Bradshaw</hi> an Upholsterer, and the said <hi>Maddison</hi> coming afterwards to the Deponents Shop, shewed the Deponent a Pistol he had prepared for that purpose. This Deponent further saith, that meeting with <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damson</hi> at <hi>Pettyes,</hi> at the white Posts in <hi>Veere</hi> street, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courseing of News, <hi>Addamson</hi> said, that they should all be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done if they did not look about them: Therefore they were resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to Kill the Earl of <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> he also speaking the same thing to the Deponent at the <hi>Grid-Iron</hi> in <hi>Holborne.</hi> This De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponent likewise saith, that <hi>Prosser</hi> told him, that he was undone, and be intended to Kill the Lord <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> for he with other of the Lords intended to undo the Lord <hi>Arundel,</hi> who was his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry good Customer. The said <hi>Prosser</hi> telling the Deponent at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time, that he was to be an Ensign under the said Lord <hi>Arun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>del.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>This Deponent also saith, that <hi>Bradshaw</hi> in discourse with him, said, that he would make no more to Kill a Protestant then to Kill a Dog or a Cat, and that he was Resolved to Kill some of the busie Lords, but the first should be the Lord <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> and the said <hi>Prosser</hi> shewed the Deponent a Pistol at the same time. This Deponent further saith, that he the Deponent, Mr <hi>Messen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, Prosser,</hi> and <hi>Maddison</hi> were at <hi>Bradley</hi>'s in <hi>Holborne</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Five Weeks before <hi>Staley</hi> was taken, where the said <hi>Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger</hi> much complaining of the severity of the Laws that were against the Papists, and much fearing that they would be put in Execution against them, by some that were no Lovers of them, and particularly the Lord <hi>Shaftesbury,</hi> who did most busie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self about them, said, that there must be speedy course taken to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:133176:105"/> prevent it; and this Deponent saith, that sometime after this, the said <hi>Prosser</hi> told him that the said <hi>Messenger</hi> was the Person that promoted the Killing of the Lord <hi>Shaftesbury.</hi> The Deponent further saith, that Mr. <hi>Goseen</hi> told him both in <hi>Covent Garden,</hi> and in the Deponents Shop, that the King and Parliament would undoe them, and if he were to Kill a man, he would Kill the King assoon as any man, and if he had him in <hi>France</hi> he would have Killed him before this.</p>
                           <p>This Deponent further saith, that about Six Monthes since, he heard Mr. <hi>Mathews</hi> the Lord <hi>Peters</hi> Priest say, that his Lord and the Lord <hi>Bellasis</hi> with some other Lords would have a good Army, and that they hoped the Catholick Religion would be settled in <hi>England.</hi> This Deponent further saith, that about a year since he heard Mr <hi>Singleton</hi> a Priest say in the presence of Mr. <hi>Hall,</hi> that he hoped he should be settled in a Parish Church before a Twelve moneth, and that he did not fear, but that the Catholick Religion would Reign in <hi>England,</hi> and that he would not make any more matter in Stabbing Forty Parliament Men, then to eat his Dinner. The Deponent saith, that he hath also heard Mr. <hi>Byfleet</hi> and Dr <hi>Guilding</hi> say several times, that they turned divers People from the Protestant Religion to the Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Religion; and they hoped they should turn many more, the Deponent also believes, that the said <hi>Hall</hi> always received the Money for the said <hi>Singleton,</hi> which was to be distributed for Masses for the dead.</p>
                           <p>This Deponent further saith, that Mr. <hi>Groves</hi> told him, that this was no Plot, but a Plot of the Protestants own making, and when his Unkle was Condemned, he said that they were all Rogues that swore against him; the Deponent then asking him, what he thought of the Five Thousand Men which he knew were to be rais<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the said <hi>Groves</hi> Replyed, that might be in Jest, the Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent further saith, that Mr. <hi>Ridley</hi> a Chirurgion at the Lord <hi>Baltamores</hi> House in <hi>Weld▪street</hi> told him several times, that he hoped to be Chirurgion to the Catholick Army in <hi>England,</hi> and that the <hi>L. Bellasis</hi> would much stand his Friend in the concern. This Deponent further saith, that the L. <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Warders</hi> Butler told him, that M. <hi>Messenger</hi> was to kill the King, &amp; he was to have a good reward if he saved his Life, &amp; if he were killed, the said reward should be distributed amongst such friends as he should appoint, by the Lord <hi>Arundel,</hi> the Earl of <hi>Powis</hi> and the rest of the Lords that were in the same Plot. The Deponent further saith, that meeting with Mr. <hi>Messenger,</hi> after that he had asked the said <hi>Messenger,</hi> why he would Kill the King? The said <hi>Messenger</hi> answered, who told you of it? The Deponent saying, your Butler told me, the said Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senger replied we are about that thing, now therefore desired me
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:133176:106"/> not to speak of it, to any Body, afterwards the said Butler came to the Deponents shop, and told the Deponent that he had received great Anger, in that he had told the Deponent what <hi>Messenger</hi> was to attempt. This Deponent further saith, that somwhat a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove half a Year since, he heard Mr. <hi>Wolston Paston</hi> say, that young Sir <hi>Henry Bedingfield</hi> of <hi>Oxburrough Hall</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> was to have a Commission from my Lord <hi>Arundel,</hi> for a Troop of Horse in the Army to be raised by the Papists.</p>

<pb n="57" facs="tcp:133176:120"/> beyond the Seas, to set up notice in Writing in the most pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick place's of the time of their departure, and they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to take on Board all such Ecclesiasticks, as should de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire to go with them, and the Officers of the Customs were Commanded to stop all Ships that did not give such notice of their departure.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>November</hi> 1678. Another Proclamation issued, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manding that no Papist in the Kingdom should thence forth presume to Ride with, Carry, Buy, Keep, or use any Arms, whatsoever without Licence.</p>
               <p>That within 20 days after the date thereof, or 7 days after the Receipt of such Arms, they were required to deliver them up to certain of the most noted Protestants, for that purpose Named in the several Counties, who were to take such Arms, and give Receipts for what they took.</p>

               <p>20. <hi>November</hi> 1678. Another Proclamation issued, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding Papists to come to the Castle of <hi>Dublin,</hi> or into any Fort or Cittadel of that Kingdom, appointing also that the Fairs and even the weekly Markets of certain places, <hi>viz.

                  </gap>, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn an Account of their proceedings therein, with the Names of such as Occasioned or Countenanced the same, unto the Councel Board.</p>
               <p>20. <hi>November</hi> 1678. Another Proclamation issued,
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:133176:121"/> the same day promising a Reward of Ten pound for every Commissioned Officer, Five pound, for every Trooper, and Forty Shillings for every Foot Soldier to such as should discover any of them, to have been perverted to the <hi>Romish</hi> Religion or heard Mass, who had formerly taken the Oathes of Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance and Supremacy, and the like to the Discoverer of any that should afterwards be perverted, besides, that it was a Rule begun in the present Lord Lieutenants first Government, after the Kings Restauration, and ever since continued. That the Muster Master should Check the pay of every Officer and Soldier of the Army, who does not produce a Certificat from the Bishop or Minister of the place, of his having received the Sacrament according to the Church of <hi>England</hi> twice every Year.</p>
               <p>2. <hi>December</hi> 1678. That being informed, that several of the Titular Bishops and Regular Clergy had not Obeyed the Proclamation of the <hi>16th. October</hi> last for their Departure, there issued a Circular <hi>Letter</hi> from the Lord Lieutenant and Councel, whereby all Justices of the Peace are Commanded to make diligent search after them, to Commit them to Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, and to returne the Names of their Receivers and Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourors, that they may be proceeded against according to Law.</p>
               <p>12. <hi>December</hi> 1678. Another Proclamation issued, highly Resenting the slackness of the Justices, and in Executing the late Proclamation for searching after and seizing of Arms, requiring therefore further search, and proposing a Method for preventing forged Licenses, and to look upon all that should be Remiss in their Duties as Contemners of the Kings Authority, and to be proceeded against as the Abettors of those who disturb the Peace.</p>
               <p>13. <hi>December</hi> 1678, Another Proclamation issued, taking Notice of a <hi>Letter</hi> scattered in the Streets of <hi>Dublin,</hi> intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a Conspiracy against the life of the Lord Lieutenant, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising Protection and Two hundred pound Reward unto the Discoverer.</p>
               <p>And it afterwards appeared, that one <hi>Jephson</hi> a young Man perverted from his Religion by some <hi>Irish</hi> Priests was a party ingaged in that Design, and two <hi>Irish</hi> Priests his Abet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors therein were taken and put into Custody, and their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminations Transmitted to the Councel here, and from thence sent to the House of Lords.</p>
               <p>There were two great Questions, and among others un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the serious Debate of the Lord Lieutenant and Councel, from whence much ill grounded Reflection hath arisen; The
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:133176:121"/> one about securing the Principal heads of the most considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Claus or Families of the <hi>Irish,</hi> who have lost their Estates, some supposing that it might Conduce to the safety of the <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish,</hi> if such heads were in Restraint, and that their Follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers would not then Presume or Adventure to runn into Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion: But upon serious Consideration, it was thought that such a proceeding might rather quicken a Rebellion than prevent it, for the Numerous followers who depended upon their Masters interest, and Authority for the support of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves and their Families, being Angred and Affrighted at the ill Usage of their principals, and being loosened from all De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendances might rather put themselves upon some Unlawful way of living, by turning Tories, then intrust themselves to the pleasure of the Government, and in the Quality of Tories they would be equally Mischievous, and Especially to the <hi>English</hi> dispersed in their Remote Dwellings, as a small Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion.</p>
               <p>Besides, this further Reason did disswade the taking up these Chief Men as Hostages, for if their Followers were but few they could not do the <hi>English</hi> much hurt as they are, but if Strong and Numerous, it would be Easily in their Power to suppress so many <hi>English</hi> Gentlemen Living Remote, and scattered in the Country as would soon Redeem such Hosta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and thereby render all the Charge and care of such an Undertaking fruitless, and only serve to bread ill Blood. So that the Lord Lieutenant hath in some Measure steered a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Course, by shewing Civility, and giving good words to such of the heads of the <hi>Irish,</hi> as come near him, whereby he finds out only what is doing amongst their Dependents, and hath conceived this Method of Obviating Dangers, more safe than either by Rigor to Compel them, and their Followers to live always in Conjunction, and to talk of their Misfortunes, or by Imprisonment of so many of the Nobility of a Kingdom without Crimes objected, or Commands from hence, incur the Sensure of Arbitrary proceedings, which are neither safe nor fit for him to bear.</p>
               <p>Another point that hath been under Consideration before the Lord Lieutenant and Councel was, a proposal for draining the Corporations, (Especially those that are Garrisoned) from the Numbers of <hi>Irish</hi> Papists, that live amongst them, in Order to prevent any Surprize or private Conspiracy, but when it was Reflected on, that notwithstanding the several Orders and Proclamations that have from time to time been issued, from the Government, for the Repulsion of <hi>Irish</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants and Servants from the Townes and Garrisons, and
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:133176:122"/> that very few in respect of the Numbers complained of were Licenced to Return, it was manifest that it was the <hi>English</hi> themselves, who did in most places receive them in again for their own Advantage, not knowing well how to live without them, they wanted Servants, Tenants and Tradesmen, for of such are these Numbers in the Town constituted, and the <hi>Irish</hi> Papists supplied them with such, and the <hi>English</hi> did not conceive this sort of People to be so dangerous as beneficial unto them, so that the Lord Lieutenant and Councel, do on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbear their expulsion in whole or in part, but for conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency or gratification to the <hi>English,</hi> however it is certain, there can never be a true Remedy therein, as to the security and improvement of that Kingdom, unless by a large accessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>English</hi> and <hi>Protestants</hi> there, and until that shall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, all other Trials upon these sorts of <hi>Irish</hi> will be in a manner but to lay some Townes, and very much of the Lands of the <hi>Protestants</hi> quite wasted and untenanted. And yet it so fals out, that many on this side, not Considering the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position of the <hi>Irish</hi> to the <hi>English,</hi> nor the difference of the Lawes there as to Capital and Pecuniary Mulcts, from what they are in <hi>England,</hi> do think many things are defective, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause they are not there Executed, as they are and may be Executed in this Kingdom, upon these and other Reasons of weight, the two propositions aforementioned were thought Impracticable.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the principal and present security of that Kingdom, consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering in the Ballancing the Numbers of</hi> Irish <hi>with a Superiori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Strength, and leaving them Naked and the</hi> English <hi>in Armes, the Lord Lieutenant and Councel did think fit to revive the Commission of Array, so that the Militia of that Kingdom hath been Raised in all parts, and is now found in a better Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition than ever it was known to be, and to supply the Defect of Armes for such Militia, there were not only appointed some Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants as publick undertakers to bring in Armes from abroad, but withal, not wholy to depend upon this performance, the Lord Lieutenant hath procured a supply out of His Majesties Stores here of Powder and Armes to the Value of about Thirteen thousand, which are now actually landed in</hi> Ireland, <hi>and for payment of which, he himself stands ingaged to the Office of Ordinance here, until a Parliament do meet in</hi> Ireland <hi>to make provision for things of this Importance, but surely to have proceeded with any degree of precipitation, while the</hi> English <hi>were so unfurnished had not been very prudential.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>As to His Majesties Forces in that Kingdom, they are well disciplined and well paid, and it hath pleased His Majesty late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:133176:122"/> to send over a Reenforcement of about 1200 men, and the Army is so distributed, as that the Cities (which are the Garrisons of that Kingdom,) are secured as well as it is possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for the proportion of such a <hi>Militia,</hi> and such an Army to make them, there is all the discountenance given to Mass Houses in all places, which the Laws of that Kingdom will bear, nor is there Licence for Arms given to any but such as need them, and for no more than is necessary for their securi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty against Tories, in their remote and scattered habitations, and for whose Loyalty and peaceable behavior the Lord Lieutenant is first sufficiently certified by some Protestants of Note.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The Forts are in as good a Condition as the Stores and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue of that Kingdom will allow, and perhaps somewhat better, but it is manifest much more is needful in every kind in case of Forraign Attempts, and therefore seeing the charge of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and the incomb of the Revenue are so exactly Ballan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by a settled establishment, that it is not in the power of the L. Lieutenant to alter the same, and that no Money can be raised from the Subject, but by Act of Parliament, therefore the Lord Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant hath been long endeavoring to have a Parliament called, and to that end, several Bills were transmitted the last Summer from the Lord Lieutenant and Councel, which now remain at the Councel Board here, together with a large Representation of the State of Accounts, depending with the Lord</hi> Rannelaugh <hi>and his Partners, who were late undertakers for the Revenue of that Kingdom, and until their shall be seizure (which since the disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of this Horrid Plot there scarce hath been,) to send back these things with the mature consideration they deserve, there is no visible means left for the raising and augmenting the Publick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, to such a proportion, as may put the Kingdom in a suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent posture of Defence, as to the Army, Fortifications, and Stores in Case of any powerful Invasion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But for the present, all things are there in full peace and quietness, and for further account of the present State of this Kingdom, and of what hath been done, or further reason of the particular here mentioned, or of any other thing which may have been left undone, there is no doubt but full satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction by the Lord Lieutenant and Councel, when such a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular enquiry and demands are made, as shall be thought convenient.</p>
               <p>The House was Adjourned into a Committee, to consider of the same, and after debate the House was Resumed, and the Earl of <hi>Bridgewater</hi> Reported, that the Committee upon Consideration of the Paper concerning the State of <hi>Ireland,</hi>
                  <pb n="62" facs="tcp:133176:123"/> are of Opinion that a Bill be prepared, whereby all the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>Dublin</hi> and other parts, and Forts in <hi>Ireland</hi> (the Ports and Forts to be named in the Bill,) shall be enjoyned to take the Oathes of Allegiance and Supremacy and Tests, for distinguishing Protestants from Papists.</p>
               <p>That in the Bill, Provision be made that the Members of both Houses of Parliament there, shall take the said Oathes and Tests.</p>
               <p>That Collonel <hi>Fitz Patrick</hi> may by His Majesties Order be Commanded to repair to his own House in <hi>Ireland,</hi> and not to come to <hi>Dublin</hi> or any other place (except his own House) within Twenty Miles of such places, as the Lord Lieutenant of <hi>Ireland</hi> shall reside at, till further Order.</p>
               <p>The House agreed with the Opinion of the Committee, and made these Orders following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Upon consideration had this day of the present condition of the Kingdom of</hi> Ireland, <hi>in this time of Imminent danger.

               <p>The Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> Reported, that whereas the Lords Committees for examining Matters relating to the horrid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiracy, were appointed to Methodize the <hi>Papers</hi> now before them in Order to the sending them to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, the Lords do not hold it so proper for them to do, in Regard they are to be Judges, whereupon it is Ordered, that all such <hi>Papers</hi> as have been by His Majesties directions sent into this House relating to the late horrid Conspiracy, as also

               </p>
               <p>The Earl of <hi>Clarendon</hi> Reported, from the Lords Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittees for Examining the Matters relating to the Discovery of the late horrid Conspiracy, that <hi>Titus Oates</hi> having repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to their Lordships the Straightness of his Allowance in this Exigent of time, wherein he hath occasion of disbursing several summs of Money for furtherance of the said Discovery, the opinion of the Committee is, that an Address be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented to His Majesty from this House, that His Majey will be pleased to give Order for the speedy payment, of One hundred pounds to the said <hi>Titus Oates</hi> out of His Majesties Treasury in the Exchequer, for the purpose aforesaid.</p>

               <p>A Message was brought from the House of Commons by Mr. <hi>Booth</hi> and Others, to desire a Conference concerning the Amendments in the Bill touching the Earl of <hi>Danby.</hi>

               <p>The answer returned was, that the Lords had considered their Message, and do agree to a Conference, and appoint the same to be presently in the painted Chamber.</p>
               <pb n="71" facs="tcp:133176:132"/>
               <p> The House appointed the same Lords, who managed the former Conference to Report this Conference.</p>
               <p>The House was adjourned during Pleasure, and the Lords went to the Conference, which being ended, the House was resumed, then the Lord Privy Seal Reported the effect of the Conference, which was managed by Mr. <hi>Powle,</hi> who said, that the House of Commons Agree to some of their Lordships Amendments made to the Bill concerning the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> and others they do not.</p>
               <p>They agree that the words (Consent and Advice) he made to be (Advice and Consent).</p>
               <p>They agree the <hi>(15th.)</hi> be instead of the <hi>(10th.).</hi>
               </p>
               <p>They agree that the word (Ought) be instead of (Aught):</p>
               <p>To the rest they do not agree, for these Reasons.</p>
               <p>The addition to the Title doth shew that the Amendments made by your Lordships to this Bill, do wholly alter the nature of it, and from a Bill of Attainder have converted it into a Bill of Banishment, which the Commons cannot consent to, for these Reasons.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That Banishment is not the legal Judgement in Cases of Treason, and the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> being impeached by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons of high Treason, and fled from Justice, hath already confest the Charge, and therefore ought to have the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of high Treason for his punishment.</p>
               <p n="2">2. That Banishment being not the punishment the Law inflicts upon these Crimes, the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> might make use of this Remission of his sentence as an Argument, that either the Commons were distrustful of their proofs against him, or else that the Crimes were not in themselves of so high a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as Treason.</p>
               <p n="3">3. That the Example of this would be an incouragement to all Persons, that shall hereafter be impeached by the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to withdraw themselves from Justice, which they would always be ready to do, if not prevented by a Commitment upon their impeachment, and thereby hope to obtain a more favorable Sentence in a Legislative way, then your Lordships would be oblidged to pass upon them in your Judicial capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city.</p>
               <p>The Amendments being all in Order to this alteration, the Commons do not agree to them for the former Reasons.</p>
               <p>After some consideration, the House agreed to have a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the House of Commons this Afternoon, in the mean time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>A Message was sent to the House of Commons by Sir <hi>Miles Cooke,</hi> and Sir <hi>John Hoskins,</hi> to let the Commons know that their Lordships intend to fit this Afternoon, and to desire that they will sit likewise.</p>

               <p>THe Lord Chancellor Reported a paper containing a draught of what was prepared to be said at the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, with the House of Commons, which was read, and after some Debate, the question was put whether to agree to these words in the papers (do declare) that nothing which hath been done in the Earl of <hi>Danbyes</hi> case, shall ever be drawn into Example for the time to come, it was resolved in the Affirmative.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Ordered.</hi> That this House agree with the Committee in this Report which followeth.</p>
               <p>The Lords have desired this conference with the House of Commons, not so much to Argue and Dispute, as to Mitigate and Reconcile.</p>
               <p>They have already observed that the Debates of this Bill,
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:133176:133"/> have given too long and too great an Obstruction to publick Business, and therefore they desire you to believe that, that is the Reason which hath Chiefly prevailed with their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships to interpose in a matter of this nature.</p>
               <p>And upon this Ground it is, that if any may be found to satisfy and secure the publick fears by going less then the Bill you have proposed, the Lords do think it Advisable to Insist upon the utmost and most Rigorous satisfaction to Publick ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice, which might be demanded.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>To induce you to this compliance, the Lords do acknowledge, that Banishment is so far from being the Legal judgement in case of high Treason, that it is not the Legal judgement in any case whatsoever, since it can never be inflicted but by the Legislative Authority; but they see no Reason why the Legislative Authority should always be bound to Act to the utmost extent of their power, for their may be a prudential Necessity sometimes of making A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>batements, and might be a fatal Ill consequence of it, if it should not be so.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And the Lords to remove all Jealousies of this kind do declare, that nothing which hath been done in the Earl of</hi> Danbyes <hi>case shall ever be drawn into example for the time to come, and will so enter it upon their journals.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore their Lordships do insist upon their Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments so far, as to exclude all Attainders, and do promise themselves the Commons will in this point comply with their Lordships, who do again assure them, that their Resolutions are only grounded upon their tenderness and consideration of the publick.</p>
               <p>A Message was brought from the House of Commons by Sir <hi>Thomas Clarges</hi> and others, who brought up a Bill intituled an Act for the better securing the liberty of the subject, and for prevention of imprisonments beyond the Seas, to which their Lordships concurrence is desired.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ordered.</hi> That this Bill be read to Morrow.</p>
               <p>A Message was sent to the House of Commons by Sir <hi>Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mothy Baldwin</hi> and Sir <hi>John Franckling,</hi> to desire a present conference in the painted Chamber, concerning the Matter of the last Conference touching the Earl of <hi>Danbys</hi> Bill.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ordered.</hi> That the Committee for the Bill for freeing the City of <hi>London</hi> and Parts adjacent from <hi>Popish</hi> Inhabitants, are hereby appointed to morrow Morning at Nine of the Clock, and have Power given them to Add such clauses to the
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:133176:133"/> said Bill, as they shall think fit upon some heads, for preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Popery</hi> and to Report unto the House.</p>
               <p>The Messengers Return with this answer, that the House of Commons will give a Conference as is desired.</p>
               <p>The House was Adjourned during pleasure, and the Lords went to the Conference, which being ended, the House was resumed, and the Earl of <hi>Huntington</hi> Reported, that he had delivered the <hi>Paper</hi> to the House of Commons at the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.</p>

               <p>THe Lord Chancellor acquainted the House by the Kings command, that the House of Commons had Addressed to him for a Proclamation to be Issued out, for summoning the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> to come in, which His Majesty finding to be a Proclamation of Justice in a case before this House, His Majesty would have been Better satisfied if it had come from both Houses, and therefore desires the Advice of this House what may be fit to be done thereupon.</p>
               <p>Upon consideration had thereupon, it is Ordered by the Lords Spiritual and Temporal in Parliament Assembled, that the Lords with white Staves, and the Lord <hi>Wharton</hi> do Attend His Majesty with the humble thanks of this House, for his Communicating to this House the Address of the House of Commons to His Majesty, concerning a Proclamation for sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moning the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> and to let His Majesty know that the humble Advice of this House is, that His Majesty will be pleased to issue out such a Proclamation as is desired.</p>

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:133176:135"/>
                  <hi>waved the answering of taking Notice, that Reason and Justice being for the Bill as they sent it up, they could not yet doubt their Lordships Concurrence in.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>These being the only Motives to the passing of a Law, which being Occasioned by the Parties Flight from Justice, and in affront of this the highest Court, they hoped their Lordships who are Judges for the Kingdom, and not only for themselves will follow the Example of their Ancestors, and proceed by Rules of Law, which are to guide in passing of Acts of Parliament, as well as in Ordinary Course of Judicature. Sir</hi> Francis Winning<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton <hi>spoak next, and urged Presidents for the like Attainder old and new, as the</hi> Stat. 5. H▪ 4▪ C. 6. John Savage <hi>flying from Justice was Attainted if he came not in by a Day, so</hi> 17. Car.

               </p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>We think that when such Bills are Regular and Legal as is confest, for the Lords to change the Punishment would bring a great Prejudice to the Commons▪ when he appears for him to say the Commons agreeing to a Composition, admit their proofs are not full for Treason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Though we thirst not after</hi> Bloud, <hi>and might have consented to a Bill that gave not him Advantage instead of punishment, as this by the Amendments would do, yet as t'is, we cannot consent for that Reason.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>T'is the Earl punishes himself, our Bill is not Severe nor Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorous, but according to the Rules of Justice against a Person that is impeacht, and dares not abide a Trial.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. <hi>Flight is so Odious in the Eye of the Law, that the innocent suffer for flying as well as the Guilty, loss of goods and chattels, immediatly incurs against him that Flies from Justice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. <hi>This would shew as if different degrees of persons should have different degrees of justice, whereas the poorest</hi> English <hi>man is to have the same proceedings against him as the greatest Peers, &amp; would your Lordships so make Provision for a flying commoner, besides this is not the Flight of Innocent</hi> Moses <hi>from the</hi> Egipti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, <hi>but of a Wicked</hi> Cain <hi>out of the sence of his Guilt.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>What your Lordships Offered last conference, of not drawing into president the proceedings in the case of the Earl of</hi> Danby <hi>was mistaken by us, we thought it meant only this Parliament, not the Errors of the last, in not calling the Earl of</hi> Danby <hi>to withdraw after the Articles of Impeachment read, and the not imprisoning him, which we are glad your Lordships do us Justice in, and find the Error in the proceedings of the last Parliament.</hi>

                  <p>
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Vaughan <hi>again said, that Justice should have it's course is the prime consideration, the Earl he stops all himself, therefore he should not have Benefit thereby, but ought to find that Justice will be too hard for his Evasions.</hi>
                  </p>
               </sp>
               <p>So they delivered us the Bill again with our Amendments, with expression of hopes and desire of our Concurrence in the Bill, as they have agreed it, that Justice may have it's course, and the great Affairs of Parliament be no longer Obstructed by spending more time on his Person, who hath brought the Kingdom into so sad a condition.</p>

                           <p>The said Earl saving and reserving to himself, the Benefit of His Majesties Gratious Pardon by him hereunder pleaded; and which he humbly prayeth may be reserved to him, by protestation saith, that as to the said Articles exhibited against him, are so general and uncertain, that he cannot make any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular answer thereto, nor give any particular account thereof, so the said Earl humbly conceiveth, and is advised by his Councel, with humble submission to your Lordships Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that there is no particular charge of high Treason de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, by any Overt act, certainly Alledged in the said Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, nor any other Crime therein so certainly Alledged, and set down, that the said Earl can any way take issue thereupon, or make Answer, or his just and lawful Defence thereto; and the said Earl by protestation also saith, that it never entered into his Heart, to Incroach any Regal power to himself by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ways or means whatsoever, much less by Treating in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of War and Peace with any Forreign Prince, or Embas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sador in his the said Earls own Name, if it be so meant by the said Articles; but if it be meant by the said Articles, that the said Earl so treated in His Majesties Name, (as he hopeth it is), or gave instructions to His Majesties Embassadors a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, without communicating the same to the Secretaries of State, and the rest of His Majesties Councel, and against the Express Declaration of His Majesty and His Parliament, if any particular instance thereof had been laid down in the said Articles, the said Earl could have given a particular account thereof; and the said Earl by protestation also saith, that whatsoever the said Earl acted in such Affaires, was by the Advice and Privity of His Majesties Councel and Secretaries of State, or by His Majesties own Express command or direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, if perhaps the same were not made known to the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel or Secretaries of State; the said Earl also, by protestation saith, that he never indeavored any Subversion of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, nor had he ever any such Design as in the Articles
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:133176:157"/> is Alledged, nor did he continue the Army when raised, nor was it in his Power so to do, but as the Money granted by Parliament for disbanding the Army came into His Majesties Exchequer, the said Earl being then Lord Treasurer, signed Warrants for payment of the Money, and every part of it, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver to the Pay-master general to be paid for his Disbanding of the said Army, and took Receipts of him Accordingly, as likewise security from him of 400000 Pounds, according to the intent and meaning of the Act of Parliament in that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half, as by the said Warrants, Receipts and Security it doth and may appear; whereby the said Earl did all that in him lay, that the Money should not be misimployed, so that no fault can justly be imputed to him on that Affair.</p>
                           <p>The said Earl by Protestation likewise saith, that he never Proposed or Negotiated for any Peace, for the <hi>French</hi> King on any terms whatsoever, nor had he ever any such Traiter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or Wicked Designs, Intents or Purposes, as are mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; nor did he ever receive any Money at all from the <hi>French</hi> King, or by his directions to or for any purpose whatsoever, nor did he ever Attempt or Indeavor to procure any sum of money whatsoever, either great or small, for the carrying on or maintaining of any such wicked or ill Design or Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, as is charged upon him.</p>
                           <p>But whatsoever he proposed or negotiated in any Affairs or Matters, relating to Peace or War, the same was with His Majesties Command, privity and directions, and not other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise, and without any Traiterous or ill Design and Purpose. The said Earl further more by Protestation saith, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not possibly imagine the reason, wherefore he should be Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pishly affected, he having always been educated in, and a Professor of the true Protestant Religion Established in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and is no way conscious to himself, of his having acted any thing contrary thereto, or tending in the least to the prejudice or subversion thereof, which might give any just cause of suspition of his being Popishly affected, as is alleadged. And as to any concealment of the late Plot and Conspiracy, against His Majesties Person and Government, after he had notice thereof, the said Earl by Protestation saith, that about the middle of <hi>August</hi> last (which was the first time the said E. ever had any the least notice of it, His Majesty sent the said Earl some Papers, which were sealed up, and did at the same time send the said Earl word, that one <hi>Kerby</hi> and Dr. <hi>Tonge</hi> would come and speak with the said Earl about the said Papers, after which His Majesty expected to hear more of the said matter from the said Earl at <hi>Windsor,</hi> whether he
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:133176:158"/> was then new gone. And within a day or two the said <hi>Kerby,</hi> did bring the said Dr. <hi>Tonge</hi> to the said Earl, and the said Earl shewing the Doctor the said Papers, he told the said Earl, that these were the same Papers he had delivered to the King, who told the said Dr. that he would send the said Earl the Papers, and had commanded him the said Doctor, to wait upon the said Earl about the same, he the said Doctor also told the said Earl, at the same time, that the said Papers were but Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies, and that the Originals of those Papers, which are in his Custody had been put under the door of his chamber, and that he did not then know who was Author of the Originals, but guessed at one who was most likely to be the Author, but would not name any Body. In some short time after the Dr. came to the said Earl again, with an additional Paper to the f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>
                              </gap>rmer, and then told the said Earl, he had met with the Man he supposed to be the Author, who had owned himself to be so, and had given him an additional Paper, of which that he then gave the said Earl was a true Copy, but the said Author would not have his name known, nor his hand seen by any, but the Doctor himself, because he feared he might be in great danger, if the Jesuits should know of him. The said Earl then went Immediatly to His Majesty to <hi>Windsor,</hi> and then gave him an account of what had passed, and so he the said Earl did as often as Dr. <hi>Tonge,</hi> (with whom only the said Earl had any conference about the matter), gave him any further Information; and doubteth not but His Majesty out of his Royal Goodness and Justice, will clear the said Earl in this particular; and the said Earl by further Protestation saith, that he made several applications, and was very importunate with His Majesty, he might have liberty to make known the same to others of His Majesties Councel, but could not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain liberty so to do, wherefore the said Earl his not revealing of such notice to others, ought to be attributed to his duty and not to any favor of Popery, or any other ill intent or design whatsoever; and by Protestation also saith, that he had no other notice of the said Plot, then what was after wards given publickly to the said Earl, and the rest of His Majesties Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cel together; neither hath the said Earl at any time suppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed any Evidence, or reproachfully or other wise discountenan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Kings Witnesses, in discovery of the Plot, but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, was the most active Person in causing the Papers of <hi>Coleman</hi> to be seized, whereby great part of the Plot was dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered. And the said Earl did deliver all the said Papers to the Privy Councel, and the same were transmitted thence to the Parliament, where the said Earl conceiveth they now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main;
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:133176:158"/> and the said Earl by protestation further saith, that he believeth neere the sum mentioned within the space of three Years, though not within the time in the Charge mentioned, hath been issued out of His Majesties Treasury, upon and by vertue of Privy Seals for secret Service; and that upon such Privy Seals, many considerable sums of money have been paid for publick uses, such payments being oftentimes made, both for saving Charge of new Privy Seals, and to save a great part of the Fees of the Exchequer, but what part of the said Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neys is meant to be paid for unnecessary Pensions, the said Earl knoweth not, but by protestation saith, that all the said Moneys were issued out by him by legal Warrant, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the usual course in such cases; and what branch of His Majesties Revennue was at any time diverted, out of the known Method and Government of the Exchequer, the said Earl knoweth not, he the said Earl during all the time he had the Honor to serve His Majesty, in the Office of Lord high Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surer, having taken all the care he could, that all and every Branch of His Majesties Revennue, should be duly brought into the Exchequer, and issued out by Tallies struck in the Ordinary and Usual manner, as he doubted not but will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear upon inspection thereof, and of the Accompts taken thereof, and still remaining in the said Exchequer. And the Earl by protestation knoweth not, which of His Majesties Commissioners are meant to have been put out of their Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, there having been divers Commissioners removed, in se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Offices of the Revennue, but sure he is, that he did not remove or procure any to be removed, for any such Reason as is Alledged, but where Commissioners were constituted by Commission in an Office, during the Kings pleasure, as all Commissioners for managing any part of His Majesties Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vennue are, if His Majesty were pleased upon any Occasion, and leave any of the former Commissioners out of the new Commission, the said Earl hopeth he hath not any ways Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended therein; and the said Earl by protestation further saith, that he must needs acknowledge, that he served a most grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and bountiful Royal Master, who was Gratiously pleased freely to Confer his Bounty upon the said Earl. Yet the said Earl saith, that he hath not during the time of serving His Majesty, in the said Office, gained any such Considerable Estate, as should Render him suspected of using any ill means for the Obtaining of it, many of his predecessors in that Office having gained in less time, more considerable and far grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Estates by it, then the said Earl hath, and yet were ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Accused for using any indirect or ill Means, is Obtaining
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:133176:159"/> or Procuring the same.

                           </opener>
                           <p>That Royal Care which His Majesty hath tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en for the General quiet and satisfaction of all his Subjects, is now more evident by these new and fresh instances of it, which I have in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand to open to you.</p>
                           <p>His Majesty hath considered with Himself, that 'tis not enough your Religion and Liberty is secure during his own Reign, but he thinks he owes it to his People, to do all that in him lyes, that these Blessings may be transmitted to your posterity, and so well secured to them, that no succession in after ages may be able to make the least alteration.</p>
                           <p>And therefore His Majesty, who hath often said in this place, that he is ready to consent to any Laws of this kind, so as the same ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend not to alter the descent of the Crown in
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:133176:166"/> a right line, nor to defeat the succession, hath now commanded this to be further explained.</p>
                           <p>And to the end it may never be in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of any Papist, if the Crown descend upon him to make any change, either in Church or State; I am commanded to tell you, that His Majesty is willing, that Provision may be made, first to distinguish a Popish from a Protestant Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor, then so to limit and circumscribe the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Popish Successor, in these cases fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, that he may be disabled to do any harm.</p>
                           <p>First, in reference to the Church, His Majesty is content that care be taken, that all Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical and Spiritual Benefices and promotions in the guift of the Crown, may be conferred in such manner, as we may be sure the incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bents shall always be of the most Pious and Learned Protestants; and that no Popish Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessor while he continues so, may have any Power to controul such presentments. In refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to the state and Civil part of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as it is already provided, that no Papist shall sit in either House of Parliament, so the King is pleased, that it be provided too, that there may never want a Parliament when the King shall happen to dye, but that the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment then in being may continue indissolvable for a competent time, or if there be no Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in being, then the last Parliament which was in being before that time, may reassemble and sit a competent time without any new Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons or Elections.</p>
                           <p>And as no Papist can by law hold any place of Trust, so the King is content that it may be further provided, that no Lords or others of the Privy Councel, no Judges of the Common Law
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:133176:167"/> or in Chancery, shall at any time during the Reign of any Popish Successor be put in, or displaced, but by the Authority of Parliament, and that care also be taken, that none but sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere Protestants may be Justices of the Peace.</p>
                           <p>In reference to the Military part, the King is willing, that no Lord Lieutenant, or Depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Lieutenant, nor no Officer in the Navy du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Reign of any Popish Successor be put in or removed, but either by Authority of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, or of such Persons the Parliament shall intrust with such Authority.</p>
                           <p>'Tis hard to invent another restraint to be put upon a Popish Successor, considering how much the Revenue will depend upon consent of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and how impossible it is to raise Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney without such consent, but yet, if any thing else can occur to the Wisdom of the Parliament, which may further secure Religion and Liberty against a Popish Successor, without defeating the right of Succession its self, His Majesty will most readily consent to it.</p>
                           <p>Thus watchful is the King of all your safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and if he could think of any thing else, that you do either want or wish to make you happy, he would make it his business to effect it for you.</p>
                           <p>God Almighty long continue this Blessed U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, between the King and his Parliament and People.</p>

               <p>As also, because there are Thousands of dissenters, that will be faithful even to death against the Common Enemy the Papists, which by the addition of the Oathes to the Test, may be tempted to think themselves in interest obliged to take the Papists part against us.

               <p>Then the E. of <hi>Sarum</hi> Reported the Effect of the Conference, <hi>(viz.)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That for Answer of the last Conference, the Managers of this Conference were commanded by the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, to say to your Lordships, that your Lordships do not Offer any answer, or satisfaction to the Commons in their necessary proposals, amicably Offered by way of supposition, that they might have been confirmed therein by their Answer from your Lordships, that your Lordships do intend in all the Proceedings upon the Impeachments now depending before your Lordships, to follow the usual Course and Methods of Parliaments.</p>
               <p>And further, that your Lordships have not given the least Answer or Satisfaction to the Commons, concerning your Lordships Addressing to the King for a high Steward, though the Commons proposed their desire of satisfaction in that Matter, in as cautions Terms as could be, on purpose to avoid all disputes about Judicature.</p>

               <p>The Messengers sent to the House of Commons, to desire a Conference upon the Earl of <hi>Danbys</hi> Petition, return with this answer, that the Commons will give a Conference, as is desired.</p>
               <p>The House was adjourned during pleasure, and the Lords went to the Conference, which being ended, the House was Resumed; the Lord Privy Seal Reported, that the Managers have acquainted the House of Commons with the Petition of the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> and told them, this House did desire to know of them, whether they have made any such Vote.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ordered.</hi> That the Clerk of the Parliament, shall of course issue out such Orders, for summoning such Persons, as the Lords, who are Prisoners in the <hi>Tower,</hi> or any of them, shall from time to time send in the Names of, to be summoned appear, as Witnesses to be made use of in their Defences, upon their respective Trials.</p>

                  </gap> have met this Morning with a Committee of the House of Commons, where the Commons acquainted the Lords, that they had reported to their House the Vote of this House, and the desi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>e of the Lords Spiritual, which occasioned the House of Commons to give this further instruction to their Committee, <hi>(viz.)</hi> to insist on their former Vote of the House, that the Lords Spiritual ought not to have any Vote in the proceedings against the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> and when that matter shall be setled, and the Method of proceedings adjusted, their House will be then ready to proceed upon the Tryal of the pardon of the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> against whom the House of Commons hath already demanded Judgment, and afterwards to the Tryal of the Five Lords in the <hi>Tower.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon which the Lords told them, they had no Authority to debate this matter.</p>
               <p>The Commons then further said, that the Lords Resoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which was Offered, was no answer to their proposition,
<pb n="174" facs="tcp:133176:184"/> which comprehended the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> as well as the Five Lords; besides, the Lords answer was doubtful, for it appears, that the Bishops asked leave to be absent, but it appears not that it was granted, then consequently the Bishops must Sit in Court at the Tryals; the Commons conceive that the Bishops absenting themselves by way of leave, is a strong implication of a right asserted, which they cannot allow can ever be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, and think there is the same reason for the Bishops be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing absent from the Tryal, upon the pardon, as at the Tryal of the other Five Lords, and that the naming of a day for the Tryal of the Five Lords, before the Tryal of the Pardon of the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> against whom the Commons have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy demanded Judgment, is the putting that last, which they desire should be first.</p>
               <p>To which the Lords told them, they were not impowered to debate, but would import these matters to the House.</p>
               <p>The Commons hereupon replyed, they were ready to go on, and that for want of these Tryals all publick business stands still, but the Lords seem to lay the stop at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons door, by naming a day, which they conceive ought not to have been appointed, before the Methods be considered; for the Lords have not answered the Commons in matter of right, which is necessary first to be adjusted, and they desire your resolution as to that matter, for they conceive they have no right, and the Lords may as well make the Judges part of their Court, as the Bishops in this point.</p>
               <p>The Commons will give no disturbance to the Antient Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature, for they own that to be sacred, and they conceive they have a right to know, before what Court they shall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, and they hope the Lords will consider of their having appointed a day, before the Methods be considered, and will give them leave to wonder at it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Ordered,</hi> that <hi>Edmond Warcup</hi> Esq one of the Deputy Lieuteuants and Justices of the Peace for the County of <hi>Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlesex,</hi> who by order of this House hath searched the House of Viscount <hi>Stafford,</hi> called or known by the name of <hi>Tart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hall,</hi> and seized some Papers there, do forthwith transmit the said Papers to the secret Committee of the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, and for so doing this shall be a sufficient Warrant.</p>

               <p>The Lord President, that on <hi>Saturday</hi> the Lords delivered to the Commons, what was Resolved and Ordered the day before, touching the Bishops being at the Tryal of the Five Lords, as also concerning the Earl of <hi>Danbys</hi> Tryal, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise touching the Paper containing the Rules <hi>de bene esse,</hi> to be observed by the Lords at the Tryals, and told the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, that that was all they had in Command to say.</p>
               <p>To which the Commons answered, that since the Lords have not thought fit to give such satisfactory Answers to the propositions, formerly made by them as they required, they have received Institutions from the House, to give no Answer to the Propositions made by the Lords, till the Commons for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Propositions be Answered.</p>
               <p>That the Lords Committees met the Committee of the House of Commons again this Morning, where the Commons said, that they had received Instructions this Morning from their House, to propose to the Lords, whether they be yet im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to give any Answer to the propositions made by the

               <p>The Messengers return with this Answer, that the House of Commons will give a free Conference as is desired.</p>
               <p>The same Lords, who managed the last free Conference, are to manage this.</p>
               <p>A Message was brought from the House of Commons by Sir <hi>Thomas Meres, &amp;c.</hi> to desire their Lordships would please to Sit a convenient time.</p>
               <p>The Answer returned was, the Lords have considered their Message, and will fit a convenient time.</p>
               <p>The House was Adjourned during pleasure, and the Lords went to the Conference, which being ended, the House was Resumed</p>
               <p>The Lord President Reported, that the Lords have deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Lordships Resolutions to the amendments in the Bill, concerning the liberty of the Subject to the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, who after some discourse said, they would acquaint the House of Commons therewith, and receive their directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons therein.</p>
               <p>A Message was brought from the House of Commons by Sir <hi>John Trever, &amp;c.</hi> to desire a Conference upon Matters of great Importance to the Kingdome, and for preserving a good Correspondence between the two Houses.</p>
               <p>The Answer returned was, that the Lords agree to a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference as is desired, and appoint the same to be presently in the Painted Chamber.</p>
               <p>The House was Adjourned, and the Lords went to the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, which being ended, the House was Resumed.</p>
               <p>The Lord President Reported, the effect of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with the House of Commons <hi>(viz)</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Commons have always desired, that a good corres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence may be preserved between the two Houses.</p>
               <p>There is now depending between your Lordships and the Commons, a Matter of the greatest weight, in the Trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>action of which, your Lordships seem to apprehend some diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in the matters proposed by the Commons.</p>
               <p>To clear this, the Commons have desired this Conference, and by it they hope, to manage to your Lordships, that the propositions of the House of Commons made by their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee,
<pb n="188" facs="tcp:133176:191"/> in relation to the Tryal of the Lords in the <hi>Tower,</hi> have been only such as are well Warranted by the Laws of Parliament, and constitution of the Government, and in no sort entreth upon the Judicature of the Peers, but are most necessary to be insisted upon, that the Antient Rights of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament may be maintained.</p>
               <p>The Commons readily acknowledge, that the Crimes Charged upon the Earl of <hi>Powis,</hi> Viscount <hi>Stafford,</hi> Lord <hi>Petre,</hi> Lord <hi>Arundel</hi> of <hi>Warder,</hi> and Lord <hi>Bellasis,</hi> are of deep Guilt, and call for speedy Justice, but withal, they hold any Change in Judicature in Parliament, made without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent in full Parliament to be of pernicious consequence, both to His Majesty and His Subjects, and conceive themselves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged, to transmit to their Posterity, all the Rights, which of this kind they have received from their Ancestors, and by putting your Lordships in mind of the progress, that has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready been between the two Houses, in relation to the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions made by the Commons, and the reasonableness of the propositions themselves; they doubt not but to make it appear, their aime has been no other than to avoid such Consequence, and to preserve that right, and that there is no delay of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice on their parts, and to that end, do offer to your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships, the ensuing Reasons and Narrative.</p>

<pb n="189" facs="tcp:133176:191"/> in framing and adjusting a Bill, for causing the Earl of <hi>Danby</hi> to appear and answer that Justice, from which he was fled, had been saved, and had been imployed for the preservation of His Majesties Person, and the security of the Nation, and in Prosecution of the other Five Lords, neither had he had the opportunity of procuring of himself, that Illegal Pardon, which bears date the first of <hi>March</hi> last past, and which he hath now Pleaded in Bar of his Impeachment, nor of wasting so great a proportion of the treasure of the Kingdom, as he hath done, since the Commons exhibited their Articles of Impeachment against him.</p>

               <p>Upon Consideration of this Message, the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons found, that the admitting the Lords Spiritual to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cise Jurisdiction in these Cases, was an Alteration in the Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicature in Parliament, and which extended as well to the proceedings against the Five Lords, as the Earl <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <p>And that the said days of Tryal, appointed by your Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ships were so near to the time of the said Message, that these matters, and the Methods of proceedings upon the Tryals, could not be adjusted by conference, between the two Houses before the days so nominated, and consequently the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons could not then proceed to Tryal, unless the zeal they had for speedy Judgment against the Earl of <hi>Danby,</hi> that so they might proceed to the Tryal of the other Five Lords, should induce them at this Juncture, both to admit the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement of your Lordships Jurisdiction, and to sit down un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der these or any hardships, (though with the hazard of all the Commons Power of Impeaching for time to come rather than the Tryal of the Five Lords should be deferred for some short time, whilst these matters might be agreed on and set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led.</p>

                  </gap>ve their Votes in proceedings, upon the Impeachments; that their desire of leave to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw at the said Trial, is only an evasive answer to the before mentioned Vote of the Commons, and chiefly intended as an Argument, for a Right of Judicature in proceedings upon Impeachments, and as a reserve to judge upon the Earl of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byes</hi> plea of Pardon, and upon these, and other like Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, although no such Power was ever claimed by their predecessors, but it is utterly denied by the Commons.</p>
               <p>And the Commons are the rather induced to believe it so intended, because the very a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>king leave to withdraw, seems to imploy a Right to be there, and that they cannot be absent without it, and because by this way they would have it in their Power, whether or no for the future, either in the Earl of <hi>Danbyes</hi> case, or any other, they will ever ask leave to be ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent,
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:133176:193"/> and the Temporal Lords a like power of denying leave, if that should once be admitted necessary, the Commons are therefore Obliged, not to proceed to the Trial of any of the Lords the <hi>27th.</hi> of this instant <hi>May,</hi> but to adhere to their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foresaid Vote, &amp; for their so doing, besides what hath been now, and formerly by them said to your Lordships, do Offer these reasons following.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Because, your Lordships have received the Earl of <hi>Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bys</hi> Plea of Pardon, with a very long and usual protestation, wherein he hath aspersed His Majesty with false suggestions, as if His Majesty had commanded or countenanced the Crimes he stands charged with, and particularly suppressing and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the discovery of the plot, and indeavoring to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce an arbitrary and tyrannical Way of Government, which remains as a scandal upon record against His Majesty, tending to render his Person and Government odious to his People, against which it ought to be the first and principal Care of both Houses to vindicate His Majesty, by doing Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice upon the said Earl.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The setti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>g up a Pardon, to be a Bar of an Impeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, defeats the whole use and effect of Impeachments, and should this point be admitted, or stand doubted, it would totally discourage the exhibiting any for the future, whereby the chief Institution for the preservation of the Government, (and consequently the Government it self, would be destroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) and therefore the case of the said Earl, (which in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence concerns all Impeachments whatsoever,) ought to be determined, before that of the said five Lords, which is but their particular case.</p>
               <p>And without resorting to any Authorities of greater Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, the Commons desire your Lordships to take notice, (with the same regard they do) of the declaration, which that excellent Prince <hi>Charles</hi> the first of blessed Memory made in this behalf, in his answer to the 19. Propositions of both Houses of Parliament, wherein sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ing the several parts of this regulated Monarchy; he saies the King, the House of Lords, and the House of Commons have each particular Priviledges, and amongst those which belong to the King, he reckons power of pardoning, after the enumerating of which, and others his Perogatives, His Majesty adds thus again, that the Prince may not make use of the high and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Power, to the hurt of those, for whose good he hath it, and make use of the name of publick Necessity, for the gain his private Favorits, and Followers, to the detriment of his people; the House of Commons (an excellent Conserver of
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:133176:193"/> Liberty <hi>&amp;c.)</hi> is solely intrusted with the first Propositions, concerning the levying of moneys, and for the impeaching of those, who for their own ends (though countenanced by any surreptitiously gotten Command of the King, have violated that Law) which is bound, when he kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ws it to protect, and to the Protection of which they were bound, to advise him at least not to serve him in the contrary, and the Lords being trusted with a judicatory Power, are an excellent Skreen and Back, between the Prince and the People, to assist each a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any Incroachments of the others, and by such Judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to preserve that Law, which <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ught to be the Rule of every one of the three <hi>&amp;c.;</hi> therefore the power legally placed in both Houses, is more than sufficient to prevent and restrain the Power of Tyranny <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>3 ly. Until the Commons of <hi>England</hi> have right done them against this Plea of Pardon, they may justly apprehend, that the whole Justice <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>f the Kingdom in the case of the five Lords may be Obstructed, and Defeated by pardons of like nature.</p>
               <p n="4">4. An Impeachment is vertually the Voice of every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Subject of this Kingdom crying out against an Oppressi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by which every member of that body is equally wounded, and it will prove a matter of ill Consequence that the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sality of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>eople, should have Occasion ministered and continued to them, to be apprehensive of utmost Danger from the Crown, from whence they of right expect Protection.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The Commons exhibited Articles of Impeachment, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the said Earl before any against the other five Lords, and demanded Judgement upon those Articles, whereupon your Lordships having appointed the Trial of the said Earl, to be before that of the other five Lords; knew your Lordships have since inverted this Order, gives a great cause of doubt to the House of Commons, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 word">
